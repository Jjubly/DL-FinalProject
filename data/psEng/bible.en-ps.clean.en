In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
The earth was without form and empty. Darkness covered the deep water. The Spirit of God hovered over the waters.
Then God said: "Let there be light!" And there was light.
God saw that the light was good. God separated the light from the darkness.
God called the light day. He called the darkness night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.
Then God said: "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters. Let it separate the waters from the waters."
God made the expanse. He separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. It was so.
God called the expanse heaven. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
Then God said: "Let the waters below the atmosphere be gathered into one place. Let the dry land appear." It was so.
God called the dry land earth. The gathering of the waters He called seas. God saw that it was good.
Then God said: "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them." It was so.
The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind. God saw that it was good.
There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
Then God said: "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. Let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.
"Let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth." It was so.
God made the two great lights. The sun was to govern the day. The moon was to govern the night. He made the stars also.
He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth.
The lights were to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.
There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
God said: "Let the waters be filled with many kinds of living beings, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky."
God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves in the waters after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.
God blessed them and said: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
God said: "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." It was so.
God made the wild animals according to their kinds. He made the livestock according to their kinds and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. God saw that it was good.
Then God said: "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness. Let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground."
God created man in his own image. In the image of God he created him. He created male and female.
God blessed them and said to them: "Be fruitful and increase in number. Fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and dominate the birds of the air. Have dominion over every living creature that moves on the ground."
Then God said: "I give you every plant that bears seed on the face of the entire earth. I also give you every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
"Also every beast of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground; everything that has the breath of life in it, I give every green plant for food." It was so.
God saw all that he had made. It was very good. There was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.
The heavens and the earth and their immense arrangement were completed.
By the seventh day God had finished his work. He rested from all his work on the seventh day.
God blessed the seventh day and made it holy. This is because he rested from all the work of creation he had done.
This is the account of when Jehovah God created the heavens and the earth.
No shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth. No plant of the field had yet sprung up, for Jehovah God had not sent rain on the earth. There was no man to work the ground.
Mist came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
Jehovah God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. The man became a living being.
Now Jehovah God planted a garden in the east, in Eden. He put the man he had formed there.
Jehovah God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground, trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
A river watering the garden flowed from Eden. From there it was separated into four headwaters.
The name of the first river is the Pishon. It winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
The gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there.
The name of the second river is the Gihon. It winds through the entire land of Cush.
The name of the third river is the Tigris. It runs along the east side of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
Jehovah God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
Jehovah God commanded the man: "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden.
"But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When you eat of it you will surely die."
Jehovah God said: "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
Then Jehovah God formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to let him name them. Whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But no suitable helper was found for Adam.
Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. While he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
Then Jehovah made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man. He brought her to the man.
The man said: "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called ‘ Woman. ’ ’ This is because she was taken out of Man."
This is the reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife. They will become one flesh.
The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
Now the serpent was craftier than any of the wild animals Jehovah God had made. He said to the woman: "Did God really say, you must not eat from any tree in the garden?"
The woman said to the serpent: "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden.
‘ "However, God did say: ‘ You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not touch it, or you will die. ’"
"You will not die," the serpent said to the woman.
"God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened. Then you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
Then the eyes of both of them were opened. They realized they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
The man and his wife heard the sound voice of Jehovah God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day. They hid from Jehovah, among the trees of the garden.
But Jehovah God called to the man: "Where are you?"
He Adam answered: "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."
And he said: "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
Adam said: "The woman you put here with me gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."
Then Jehovah God said to the Eve: "What is this you have done?" The woman answered: "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
So Jehovah God said to the serpent: "Because you have done this you are cursed above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
"And I will put enmity hostility hatred between you and the woman, and between your offspring seed and hers. He will bruise overwhelm crush you in the head, and you will bruise overwhelm crush him in the heel."
He said to the woman: "I will greatly increase your pains in childbirth; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
He said to Adam: "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘ You must not eat of it, ’ ’ cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
"It will produce thorns and thistles for you. You will eat the plants of the field.
"You will eat your food by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground. You came from the ground. For dust you are and to dust you will return."
Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.
Jehovah God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
Jehovah said: "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."
Therefore Jehovah God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
Adam had sexual intercourse with his wife Eve. She became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said: "With the help of Jehovah I have brought forth a man."
Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.
As time went by, Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Jehovah.
But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn firstlings of his flock. Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and his offering.
He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his face was downcast he had a bad attitude.
Jehovah said to Cain: "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?
"If you do what is right, will not your attitude improve? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door. It desires to have you, but you must master it."
While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
Jehovah asked Cain: "Where is your brother Abel?" "I do not know," he replied. "Am I my brother’s keeper?"
Jehovah said: "What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood life cries out to me from the ground.
"Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
"When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer vagabond on the earth."
Cain said to Jehovah: "My punishment is more than I can bear.
"You are driving me from the land today. I will be hidden from your presence. I will be a restless homeless wanderer on the earth. And whoever finds me will kill me."
Jehovah replied to him: "If anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then Jehovah put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
Cain went out from Jehovah’s presence and lived in the land of Nod Fugitiveness. Nod is east of Eden.
Cain had intercourse with his wife. She became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Later Cain built a city. He named it after his son Enoch.
To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of copper and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.
Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
"If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
Adam had intercourse with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth. She said: "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."
Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on proclaim the name of Jehovah.
This is the written genealogy of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.
He created them male and female and blessed them. When they were created, he called them Mankind.
When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.
After Seth was born, Adam lived eight hundred years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether, Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years, and then he died.
Seth lived one hundred and five years when he became the father of Enosh.
After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether, Seth lived nine hundred and twelve years, and then he died.
Enosh lived ninety years. He became the father of Kenan.
After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years and had other sons and daughters.
Enosh lived a total of nine hundred and five years, and then he died.
Kenan lived seventy years. He became the father of Mahalalel.
After that Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether, Kenan lived nine hundred and ten years, and then he died.
When Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years and had other sons and daughters.
Mahalalel lived a total of eight hundred and ninety-five years, and then he died.
When Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, he became the father of Enoch.
After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years and had other sons and daughters.
Jared lived a total of nine hundred and sixty-two years, and then he died.
When Enoch lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.
After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether, Enoch lived three hundred and sixty-five years.
Enoch walked with God. Then he was no more, because God took moved him away.
When Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred eighty-two years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether, Methuselah lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and then he died.
When Lamech had lived one hundred and eighty-two years, he had a son.
He named him Noah. He said: "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground Jehovah has cursed."
After Noah was born, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years and had other sons and daughters.
Lamech lived a total of seven hundred seventy-seven years, and then he died.
After Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them.
The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful. They married any of them they chose.
Jehovah said: "My Spirit will not contend judge plead with man forever, for he is mortal and corrupt. Therefore his days will be a hundred and twenty years."
The NEPHILIM were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God had sexual intercourse with the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
Jehovah saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become. Every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.
Jehovah was grieved that he had made man on the earth. His heart was grieved with pain.
So Jehovah said: "I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth. All of them: men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air. I am sorry that I created them."
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
This is the ACCOUNT OF NOAH. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. He walked with God.
The earth was corrupt in God’s sight. It was full of violence.
God saw how corrupt the earth had become. All the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
God said to Noah: "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am going to destroy them with the earth.
"BUILD AN ARK of cypress wood a resinous tree. Make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
"This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be four hundred and fifty feet long, seventy-five feet wide, and forty-five feet high.
"Build a roof on it and finish the ark to within eighteen inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle, and upper decks.
"I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens. Every creature that has the breath of life in it, everything on earth will perish.
"But I will establish my covenant with you. You will enter the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.
"Bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
"Take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."
Noah did everything exactly as God commanded him.
Jehovah said to Noah: "Go into the ark, you and your whole family. For I have found you righteous in this generation.
"Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate.
"Also take seven of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.
"Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."
Noah did all that Jehovah commanded him.
Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,
male and female came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.
Seven days passed and the floodwaters came on the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the sky were opened.
Rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.
They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.
Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, just as God had commanded Noah. Then Jehovah shut him in.
The flood came upon the earth for forty days. As the waters increased, they lifted the ark high above the earth.
The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth. The ark floated on the surface of the water.
They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet.
Every living thing that moved on the earth perished: birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out. Men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark. He sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.
The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the skies were closed. So the rain stopped falling from the sky.
Water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down.
On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
The waters continued to recede until the tenth month. On the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
After forty days Noah opened the window he constructed in the ark.
He sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the water dried up from the earth.
Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.
The dove, however, could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth. It returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and held the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.
He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.
By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
God said to Noah:
"Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
"Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you, the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground. They will multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it."
Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.
All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds, everything that moves on the earth came out of the ark, one kind after another.
Noah built an altar to Jehovah and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.
Jehovah smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of man, for the intent of his heart is evil from childhood. I will never again destroy every living creature, as I have done.
"As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will never cease."
God blessed Noah and his sons. He said: "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.
"All the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air will be filled with fear and dread of you. Every creature that moves along the ground and all the fish of the sea are placed under your control.
"Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
"You must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
"I will require your lifeblood as an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. I will demand an accounting from each man for the life of his fellow man.
"Whoever sheds the blood of man will have his blood shed by man. For man was made in the image of God.
"You should be fruitful and increase in number. Multiply increase on the earth."
Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
"I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
" and with every living creature that was with you, the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you, every living creature on earth.
"I establish my covenant with you: Never again will the waters of a flood destroy all life. Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."
God said: "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:
"I give you my rainbow in the clouds. It will be the sign of my covenant with the world of mankind.
"Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
"I will remember my covenant with you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters flood to destroy all life.
"Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the long lasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."
God said: "This is the sign of the covenant I have established with all life on the earth."
Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth.
Noah, a man of the soil, planted a vineyard.
He drank some of its wine. He became drunk and lay undressed inside his tent.
Ham, father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside.
Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders. Then they walked in backward and covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father’s nakedness.
Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him.
He Noah said: "Canaan is cursed! He will be a lowly slave to his brothers."
He also said: "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
"May God extend the territory of Japheth. And may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave."
After the flood, Noah lived three hundred and fifty years.
Noah lived a total of nine hundred and fifty years, and then he died.
This is the genealogy of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who also had sons after the flood.
The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim Dodanim.
From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.
The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah. That is why it is said: "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Jehovah."
The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in Shinar.
From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
Pathrusites, Casluhites, and Caphtorites.
Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered,
and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth. Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram.
The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech.
Arpachshad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.
Two sons were born to Eber. One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided. His brother was named Joktan.
Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
The entire world had one language and common words.
As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar Babylon and settled there.
They said to each other: "Let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
Then they said: "Let us build ourselves a city, with a lofty tower that reaches into space, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth."
But Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building.
Jehovah said: "If they become one people speaking the same language, nothing will be impossible for them. They have begun to do this.
"Let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."
Jehovah scattered them from there over all the earth. They stopped building the city.
That is why it was called Babel confusion because Jehovah confused the language of the whole world. Jehovah scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth.
This is the genealogy of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was one hundred years old, he became the father of Arpachshad.
After he became the father of Arpachshad, Shem lived five hundred years and had other sons and daughters.
When Arpachshad lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah.
After he became the father of Shelah, Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years and had other sons and daughters.
Shelah lived thirty years. He became the father of Eber.
After he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived four hundred and thirty years and had other sons and daughters.
When Eber lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg.
After he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years and had other sons and daughters.
When Peleg lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu.
After he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years and had other sons and daughters.
When Reu lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug.
After he became the father of Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years and had other sons and daughters.
When Serug lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor.
After he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years and had other sons and daughters.
Nahor lived twenty-nine years; he became the father of Terah.
After he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years and had other sons and daughters.
Terah lived seventy years. He became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
This is the genealogy of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.
Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
Now Sarai was barren. She had no children.
Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
Terah lived two hundred and five years. He died in Haran.
Jehovah said to Abram: "Leave your country, your people, and your father’s household, and go to the land I will show you.
"I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you. I will make your name great. You will be a blessing.
"I will bless those who bless you. I will curse whoever curses you. All the people on earth will be blessed through you."
So Abram left, just as Jehovah told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran.
He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran. They set out for the land of Canaan and soon arrived there.
Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great oak tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
Jehovah appeared to Abram and said: "I will give this land to your offspring seed." He built an altar there to Jehovah, who had appeared to him.
From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent. Bethel was on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to Jehovah and called on the name of Jehovah.
Abram continued toward the Negev.
There was a famine in the land. Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while, because the famine was severe.
He was about to enter Egypt. He said to his wife Sarai: "I know what a beautiful woman you are.
"When the Egyptians see you, they will say: ‘ This is his wife. ’ ’ Then they will kill me, but will let you live.
"Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake, and my life will be spared because of you."
When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman.
Pharaoh’s officials saw her. They praised her to Pharaoh. She was taken into his palace.
He treated Abram well for her sake. Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.
Jehovah inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What have you done to me?" he asked. "Why did you not tell me she was your wife?
"Why did you say: ‘ She is my sister, ’ ’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"
Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.
Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.
Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
He traveled from place to place from the Negev until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier.
This was where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
Lot moved about with Abram. He also had flocks and herds and tents.
But the land could not support them while they stayed together. Their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.
Quarreling arose between Abram’s herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
Abram said to Lot: "Let us not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are brothers.
"Is not the whole land before you? Let us part company. If you go to the left, I will go to the right. If you go to the right, I will go to the left."
Lot looked up and saw that the district of the Jordan River was well watered, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. This was before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:
Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
The men of Sodom were wicked and sinned greatly against Jehovah.
After Lot had parted from Abram, Jehovah said to Abram: "Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west.
"All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring descendants from generation to generation.
"I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth. If anyone could count the dust, your offspring could be counted.
"Go walk through the length and breadth of the land that I am giving to you."
Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron. He built an altar to Jehovah there.
In the days of King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim,
these four kings made war with King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Zoar.
These joined forces in the Valley of Siddim at the Dead Sea.
They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years. They rebelled in the thirteenth year.
In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness.
They turned back and came to En-mishpat Kadesh, and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Zoar went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim.
They fought against King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar, four kings against five.
The Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen tar pits. As the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them. The rest fled to the hill country.
The enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food provisions, and went their way.
They also captured Lot, son of Abram’s brother, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. They were Abram’s allies.
Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive. Abram led his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, in pursuit as far as Dan.
He divided his forces against them by night. He and his servants routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
Then he brought back all the goods. He also brought back his nephew Lot and all the men and women.
As soon as the king of Sodom returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, he went out to meet Abram at the King's Valley of Shaveh.
King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.
He blessed him and said: "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, maker of heaven and earth.
"Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" Abram gave him one tenth of everything.
Then the king of Sodom said to Abram: "Give me the people, but take the goods for yourself."
But Abram said to the king of Sodom: "I have sworn to Jehovah, God Most High, maker of heaven and earth:
" I will take nothing. Not a thread or a sandal strap. You will not be able to say: ' I have made Abram rich. ’
"Let the young men who came with me take their portion: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre."
The word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be afraid, Abram; I am your shield. Your reward shall be very great."
Abram said: "O Jehovah God, what will you give me? I continue childless! The heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus."
Abram also said: "You have given me no offspring. So a slave born in my house is to be my heir."
The word of Jehovah came to him: "This man shall not be your heir. No one but your very own issue shall be your heir."
He brought him outside and said: "Look toward heaven and count the stars. Are you able to count them?" He continued: "So shall your descendants be."
He believed in Jehovah. Jehovah considered Abram’s faith as his righteousness.
Then God said to him: "I AM JEHOVAH, who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess."
Abram replied: "O Jehovah God, how will I know that I shall possess it?"
He God said to him: "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
Abram brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other. He did not cut the birds in two.
When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.
Jehovah said to Abram: "Know this for sure; your offspring will be strangers aliens in a land that is not theirs. They will be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years.
"I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve! Afterward they will come out with great possessions.
"As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace. You shall be buried at a good old age.
"They shall come back here in the fourth generation. The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."
The sun went down and it was dark. A smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram. He said: "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
She said to Abram: "Jehovah has kept me from having children. Go sleep with my maidservant. Perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
After Abram lived in Canaan ten years, Sarai, his wife, gave her Egyptian maidservant Hagar to her husband to be his wife.
Abram had intercourse with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
Then Sarai said to Abram: "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms; she knows she is pregnant and she despises me. May Jehovah judge between you and me."
"Your servant is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar. So she ran away from her.
The angel of Jehovah found Hagar near a spring in the desert. It was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
He said: "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I am running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered.
Then the angel of Jehovah told her: "Go back to your mistress and submit to her.
"I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count."
Jehovah’s angel also said: "You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael means: God hears. Jehovah has heard of your misery.
"He Ishmael will be a wild donkey of a man. His hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him. He will live in hostility toward all his brothers."
She called the name of Jehovah, who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me, for she said, ‘ I have not seen the one who sees me. ’ "
That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi Well of the Living One Who Sees Me. It is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.
Hagar bore Abram a son. Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
Abram was ninety-nine years old. Jehovah appeared to him and said: "I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.
"I will establish my covenant between us. I will greatly increase your numbers."
Abram fell on his face and God said to him:
"This is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
"You will no longer be called Abram Exalted Father. Your name will be Abraham means Father of Many. I have made you a father of many nations.
"I will make you very fruitful. I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
"I will establish my covenant as a long lasting covenant between us. It will be for your descendants after you, for the generations to come. I will be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
"The whole land of Canaan, where you are now a guest alien foreigner stranger, I will give a long lasting possession to you and your descendants after you. I will be their God."
Then God said to Abraham: "As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
"This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
"You are to undergo circumcision. It will be the sign of the covenant between us.
"Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be a long lasting covenant.
"Any male not circumcised in the flesh will be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant."
God continued: "Do not call your wife Sarai any longer. Her name will be Sarah.
"I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her."
Abraham fell to his face. He laughed and said to himself: "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"
Abraham said to God: "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"
God replied: "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son! You will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as a long lasting covenant for his descendants after him.
"Concerning Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him. I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
"But my covenant I will establish with Isaac. Sarah will bear him to you by this time next year."
When he finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.
Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised.
His son Ishmael was thirteen.
Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day.
Every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
Jehovah appeared again to Abraham by the oak grove of Mamre. He was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day.
He looked up and noticed three men coming toward him. He ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed to the ground.
Abraham said: "My Lord, if I have now found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
"Please. Let a little water be brought. Wash your feet and rest under the tree.
"I will bring a bite to eat to refresh you. Stay a while before you continue your journey." They responded: "Very well, do as you have said."
Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said: "Quick! Make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes."
Then Abraham ran to the herd. He selected a fat calf and told a servant to butcher it and prepare it.
He took butter and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree as they ate.
Then they said to him: "Where is Sarah your wife"? He responded: "Here, in the tent."
He said: "Next year I will give you and Sarah a son." Sarah was listening in the tent door behind him.
Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself. She said to herself: " After I have grown old, shall I have a baby? My lord is old also. "
Jehovah said to Abraham: "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ' Shall I surely bear a child, since I am old? '
"Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life. Sarah shall have a son!"
Sarah denied saying: "I did not laugh!" She was afraid. He said: "But you did laugh!"
Then the men stood up from their meal and started in the direction of Sodom. Abraham went with them to send them on the way.
Jehovah said: "Shall I hide what I am doing from Abraham?
"Abraham will definitely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him.
"I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household; and that they may remain in the righteous and just way of Jehovah. Jehovah will bring to Abraham what he told him."
Jehovah said: "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave,
"I will go down now and see whether they have done the bad things I have been told. Then I will know."
The men left there and went toward Sodom. Abraham still stood before Jehovah.
Abraham came near and said: "Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?
"Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city. Would you also destroy the place and not spare it because the righteous people are there?
"Surely you would not do that! Would you slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked? Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
Jehovah said: "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, I will spare the entire place for their sakes."
Then Abraham answered and said: "Indeed now, I who am only dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah:
"Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous. Would you destroy the entire city for lack of five?" So He God said: "If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it."
Abraham spoke again: "Suppose there should be forty found there?" God replied: "I will not do it for the sake of forty."
Abraham then said: "Do not be angry, and let me speak. Suppose thirty should be found there?" God replied: "I will not do it if I find thirty there."
Abraham then said: "Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to Jehovah: Suppose twenty should be found there?" God replied: "I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty."
Abraham again queried: "Please do not be angry as I speak once more: Suppose ten should be found there?" God said: "I will not destroy it for the sake of ten."
Jehovah went his way as soon as he finished speaking with Abraham. Abraham returned to his place.
That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom. Lot was sitting there as they arrived. When he saw them, he got up to greet them. Then he welcomed them and bowed low to the ground.
"My lords," he said, "come to my home to wash your feet, and be my guests for the night. You may get up in the morning as early as you like and be on your way again." "Oh no," they said, "We will spend the night out here in the city square."
Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. He set a great feast before them, complete with fresh unleavened unfermented bread.
They prepared to retire for the night when suddenly all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house.
They shouted to Lot: "Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out so we can have sex with them!"
Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.
"Please, my brothers," he begged, "do not do such a wicked thing.
"I have two virgin daughters. Do with them as you wish, but leave these men alone, for they are under my protection."
"Stand back!" they shouted. "Who do you think you are? We let you settle among us, and now you are trying to tell us what to do! We will treat you far worse than those other men!" They pushed Lot and began breaking down the door.
But the two angels reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door.
Then they blinded the men of Sodom so they could not find the doorway.
"Do you have any other relatives here in the city?" The angels asked. "Get them out of this place, sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else.
"We will destroy the city completely. The stench of the place has reached Jehovah. He has sent us to destroy it."
Lot rushed out to tell his sons-in-law: "Hurry! Get out of the city! Jehovah is going to destroy it." But the young men thought he was only joking.
At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent. They said to Lot: "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here. Get out of here right now, or you will be caught in the destruction of the city."
Lot still hesitated. So the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city, for Jehovah was merciful.
"Run for your lives!" The angels warned. "Do not stop and do not look behind you! Escape to the mountains, or you will die."
"Oh no, my lords, please," Lot begged.
"You have been so kind to me and saved my life, and you have granted me such mercy. But I cannot go to the mountains. Disaster would catch up to me there, and I would soon die.
"There is a small village nearby. Please let me go there instead. Do you see how small it is? Then my life will be saved."
The angel said to him: "All right, I will grant you this request too. I will not destroy the city you are talking about.
"Run there quickly! I cannot do anything until you get there. " The city is named Zoar Small.
The sun had just risen over the land as Lot came to Zoar.
Jehovah made burning sulfur and fire rain out of the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah.
He destroyed those cities, the whole Plain, all who lived in the cities, and whatever grew on the ground.
Lot’s wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt.
Early the next morning Abraham came to the place where he had stood in front of Jehovah.
He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land in the Plain. He saw smoke rising from the land like the thick smoke of a furnace.
When God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot was living, he kept Abraham in mind and allowed Lot to escape to safety.
Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he and his two daughters moved up into the hills and lived in a cave.
The older daughter said to her sister: "Our father is getting old. There are no men in the whole world to marry us so we can have children.
"Come, let us get our father drunk. Then we can sleep with him and have children by him."
That night they gave him wine to drink. The older daughter had intercourse with him. But he was so drunk that he did not know it.
The next day the older daughter said to her sister: "I slept with him last night. Let us get him drunk again tonight, and you sleep with him. Then each of us will have a child by our father."
So that night they got him drunk. The younger daughter had intercourse with him. Again he was so drunk that he did not know it.
Both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their own father.
The older daughter had a son, whom she named Moab. He was the ancestor of the present-day Moabites.
The younger daughter also had a son, whom she named Ben-ammi. He was the ancestor of the present-day Ammonites.
Abraham moved from Mamre to the southern part of Canaan and lived between Kadesh and Shur. Later, while he was living in Gerar,
he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
God appeared to the king in a dream and said: "You are going to die, because you have taken this woman. She is already married."
Abimelech had not come near her. He said: "Lord, I am innocent! Would you destroy my people and me?
"Abraham said that she was his sister. She said the same thing. I did this with a clear conscience. I have done no wrong!"
God said to him in a dream: "Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. In fact, I kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
"Give the man’s wife back to him now. He is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not give her back, you and all who belong to you are doomed to die."
So Abimelech got up early in the morning. He called all his servants and told them everything. The men were very afraid.
Then Abimelech called Abraham. He said to him: "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you? You have brought a great sin on me and on my kingdom. You have done to me things that ought not to be done."
Abimelech also asked Abraham: "What were you thinking when you did this?"
Abraham said: "I thought that because there are no people who reverence God in this place, I would be killed because of my wife.
"Besides, she is my sister. She is my father’s daughter, but not my mother’s. She is also my wife.
"When God had me leave my father’s home and travel around, I said to her: ' Do me a favor: Wherever we go, say that I am your brother. ' "
Abimelech took sheep, cattle, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him.
Abimelech said: "Look, here is my land. Live anywhere you like.
He said to Sarah: "Do not forget that I have given your brother twenty-five pounds of silver. This is to silence any criticism against you from everyone with you. You are completely cleared."
Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could have children.
Jehovah was gracious to Sarah, as he had said. Jehovah did for Sarah what he had promised.
Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age. It was at the very time God had promised him.
Abraham gave the name Isaac he laughs to the son Sarah bore him.
When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded him.
Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Sarah said: "God brought me laughter. Everyone who hears about this will laugh on account of me."
She added: "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
The child grew and was weaned. Abraham held a big feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was laughing in mockery.
This upset Abraham because of his son Ishmael.
God said to Abraham: "Do not be upset about the boy and your slave. Listen to what Sarah says, because through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name.
"I will make the slave’s son into a nation also, because he is your child."
Early the next morning Abraham took bread and a container of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder. He also gave her the boy and sent her on her way. So she left and wandered around in the desert near Beer-sheba.
When the water in the skin was used up, she left the boy under one of the bushes.
She sat across from him at a distance. She thought: "I cannot watch the boy die. " She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.
God heard the lad crying. The angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her: "What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear! God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
"Arise, lift up the lad. Hold him by the hand. I will make him a great nation."
Then God opened her eyes. She saw a well of water. She filled the skin with water and gave the lad a drink.
God was with the lad, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.
He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham. They said: "God is with you in all that you do.
"Swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity. Consider the kindness that I have shown to you. Please show it to me and to the land in which you have sojourned."
Abraham said: "I swear it."
Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water that the servants of Abimelech had seized.
Abimelech said: "I do not know who has done this thing. You did not tell me, nor did I hear of it until today."
Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech. The two of them made a covenant.
Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Abimelech asked Abraham: "What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?"
He said: "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well."
Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there the two of them took an oath.
They made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba. There he called on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.
Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for many days.
God tested Abraham. He said to him: "Abraham!" Abraham replied: "Here I am."
"Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you."
Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey. He took two of his servants and his son Isaac with him. He had cut the wood for the burnt offering. Then he set out for the place that God had told him about.
Two days later Abraham saw the place in the distance.
He said to the servants: "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship. Then we will come back to you."
Abraham made Isaac carry the wood for the sacrifice. Abraham carried a knife and live coals for starting the fire. As they walked along together,
Isaac spoke up: "Father!" He answered: "Yes, my son?" Isaac asked: "I see that you have the coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?"
Abraham answered: "God will provide one." And the two of them walked on together.
They came to the place God had told him about. Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He tied up his son and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.
Then he picked up the knife to kill him.
Jehovah’s angel shouted from heaven: "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am!" he answered.
"Do not hurt the boy or harm him in any way!" The angel said. "Now I know that you truly obey God, because you were willing to offer him your only son."
Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the bushes. So he took the ram and sacrificed it in place of his son.
Abraham named that place "Jehovah Will Provide." It is still said today: "It will be provided on the mountain of Jehovah."
The angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from heaven a second time.
He said: "I am taking an oath on my own name, declares Jehovah, that because you have done this and have not refused to give me your son, your only son,
‘ "I will certainly bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of their enemies’ cities.
‘ "All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants. This is because you obeyed my command. ’"
Abraham and Isaac went back to the servants who had come with him. They returned to Abraham’s home in Beer-sheba.
Abraham’s brother Nahor had married Milcah, and Abraham was later told that they had eight sons.
Uz was their firstborn. Buz was next. Then there was Kemuel who became the father of Aram. Their other five sons were
Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
His concubine, Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.
Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.
Sarah died in Kiriath-arba that is, Hebron in the land of Canaan. Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to cry because of her death.
Abraham left the side of his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.
He said: "I am a stranger with no permanent home. Let me have some of your property for a tomb that I can bury my dead wife."
The Hittites answered Abraham:
"Listen to us, my lord. You are a mighty leader among us. Bury your dead in one of our best tombs. Not one of us will withhold from you his tomb for burying your dead."
Abraham got up and bowed to the people of that region, the Hittites.
He said: "If you are willing to let me bury my wife here, please ask Ephron son of Zohar
to sell me Machpelah Cave. It is near the edge of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for its full price here in your presence. Then I can own it as a burial ground."
Ephron was sitting with the other Hittites at the meeting place at the city gate. He answered in the hearing of everyone there:
Once again, Abraham bowed down.
He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land. He said: "If you will only please listen to me. I will give the price of the field. Accept it from me that I may bury my dead there."
Ephron answered Abraham:
"My lord, listen to me. It is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between you and me? So bury your dead."
Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard.
Ephron’s field at Machpelah, east of Mamre, was sold to Abraham.
His property included the field with the cave in it as well as all the trees inside the boundaries of the field. The Hittites together with all who had entered the city gate were the official witnesses for the agreement.
Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre Hebron, in the land of Canaan.
The Hittites sold the field and its cave to Abraham as his property to be used as a tomb.
By now Abraham was old, and Jehovah had blessed him in every way.
Abraham said to the senior servant of his household who was in charge of all that he owned: "Take a solemn oath.
"I want you to swear by Jehovah God of heaven and earth that you will not get my son a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living.
"Instead, you will go to the land of my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac."
The servant asked: "What if the young woman will not leave home to come with me to this land? Shall I send your son back to the land you came from?"
Abraham answered: "Make sure that you do not send my son back there!
"Jehovah, the God of heaven, took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth. He spoke to me and swore to me. He said: I will give this land to your descendants. He will send his angel before you. You will take a wife for my son from there.
"You will be free from this oath if the woman is not willing to follow you. Only do not take my son back there."
The servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master. He swore to him concerning this matter.
The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and then set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand. He arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time. This is the time when women go out to draw water.
He said: "O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today. Show loving-kindness to my master Abraham.
"I am standing by the spring. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
"Let there be the girl to whom I say: ‘ Please let down your jar so that I may drink, ' and who answers: ' Drink, and I will water your camels also. ' May she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown loving-kindness to my master."
Before he finished praying, Rebekah came with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
The girl was a very attractive virgin. No man had ever had sexual intercourse with her. She went to the spring and filled her jar, and came back.
The servant ran to meet her and said: "Please give me a drink of water."
"Drink, my lord," she said. She quickly lowered her jar to her hand and gave him a drink.
When she finished giving him a drink, she said: "I will also keep drawing water for your camels until they have had enough to drink."
She quickly emptied her jar into the water trough. Then she ran back to the well to draw more water. She drew enough for all his camels.
The man quietly watched her to see whether or not Jehovah made his trip successful.
When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a fifth of an ounce and two gold bracelets weighing four ounces.
He said: "Please tell me who your father is. Is there room in his house for my men and me to spend the night?"
"My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah," she answered.
"There is plenty of straw and fodder at our house. There is also a place for you to stay."
The man knelt down and worshiped Jehovah.
He said: "Praise Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham. He has faithfully kept his promise to my master. Jehovah has led me straight to my master’s relatives."
The young woman ran to her mother’s house and told the entire story.
Rebecca’s brother was named Laban. He ran outside to go to the well where Abraham’s servant was.
Laban had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms and had heard her say what the man told her. He went to Abraham’s servant, who was standing by his camels at the well,
and said: "Come home with me. You are a man Jehovah has blessed. Why are you standing out here? I have a room ready for you in my house. There is a place for your camels."
The man went into the house. Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder. Then he brought water for Abraham’s servant and his men to wash their feet.
Food was brought. The man said: "I will not eat until I have said what I have to say." Laban responded: "Go ahead and speak."
"I am the servant of Abraham," he began.
"Jehovah has greatly blessed my master and made him a rich man. He has given him flocks of sheep and goats, cattle, silver, gold, male and female slaves, camels, and donkeys.
"Sarah, my master’s wife, did not have any children until she was very old. Then she had a son, and my master has given him everything.
"I solemnly promised my master I would do what he said. He told me: ‘ Do not choose a wife for my son from the women in this land of Canaan.
"‘ Go back to the land where I was born and find a wife for my son from among my relatives. ’
"I asked my master: ‘ What if the young woman refuses to come with me? ’
"He said to me: ‘ Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you to make your journey successful. You will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house.
"‘ If my relatives do not give her to you, then you will be free from my oath. ’"
"I came to the spring today. I prayed to Jehovah: ‘ God of my master Abraham, if now you will make my journey successful,
"‘ make it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar,"
"And she will say to me, "You drink, and I will draw for your camels also," let her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master’s son. ’
"Before I had finished speaking in my heart, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, ‘ Please let me drink. ’
"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘ Drink, and I will water your camels also ’; so I drank, and she watered the camels also.
"Then I asked her: ‘ Whose daughter are you? ’ ’ She said: ‘ The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him. ’ ’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.
"I bowed low and worshiped Jehovah, and praised Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham. He guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son.
"If you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left."
Laban and Bethuel replied: "The matter comes from Jehovah. We cannot speak to you bad or good.
"Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go. Let her be the wife of your master’s son, as Jehovah has spoken."
Abraham’s servant heard their answer. Then he bowed down to Jehovah.
The servant took out gold and silver jewelry and clothes and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.
He and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said: "Let me go back to my master."
Her brother and mother replied: "Let the girl stay with us ten days or so. After that she may go."
He said: "Do not make us stay. Jehovah has made my journey a success. Let me go back to my master."
They answered: "Let us call her and find out what she has to say."
They called Rebecca and asked: "Do you want to go with this man?" "Yes," she answered.
They allowed Rebecca and her old family servant to go with Abraham’s servant and his men."
They gave Rebecca their blessing in these words: "May you, sister, become the mother of millions! May your descendants conquer the cities of their enemies!"
Rebecca and her young women got ready. They mounted the camels to go with Abraham’s servant, and they all started out.
Isaac had come into the wilderness of "The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me." He was staying in the southern part of Canaan.
He went out in the early evening to take a walk in the fields. He saw camels coming.
Rebecca saw Isaac and she got down from her camel
She asked Abraham’s servant: "Who is that man walking toward us in the field?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil scarf and covered her face.
The servant told Isaac everything he had done.
Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent that his mother Sarah had lived in. She became his wife. Isaac loved Rebecca. He was comforted for the loss of his mother.
Abraham married another woman. Her name was Keturah.
She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan, and the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim.
The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were Keturah’s descendants.
Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
While Abraham was still alive, he gave gifts to the sons of Hagar and Keturah. He also sent their sons to live in the east far from his son Isaac.
Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years.
Then he took his last breath and died at a very old age. After a long and full life, he joined his ancestors in death.
His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.
This was the field Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. Abraham and Sarah his wife were buried there.
After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi. The Well of the Living One, My Beholder.
This is the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maid, bore to Abraham.
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,
Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.
These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps: twelve leaders according to their tribes.
Ishmael lived one hundred and thirty-seven years. Then he died and was gathered to his ancestors.
His descendants lived as nomads from the region of Havilah to Shur. This is near Egypt, in the direction of Assyria. He died in the presence of all his brothers.
This is the genealogy of Abraham’s son Isaac and his descendants. Abraham was the father of Isaac.
Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram, and sister of Laban the Aramean.
Isaac prayed to Jehovah for his wife because she was childless. Jehovah answered his prayer. His wife Rebekah became pregnant.
She was going to have twins. Before they were born they struggled against each other in her womb. She said: "Why should something like this happen to me?" She asked Jehovah for an answer.
Jehovah said: "Two nations are within you. You will give birth to two rival peoples. One will be stronger than the other. The older will serve the younger."
The time came for her to give birth. She gave birth to twin sons.
The first one was reddish. His skin was like a hairy robe, so he was named Esau.
The second one was born holding on tightly to the heel of Esau. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
The boys grew up. Esau became a skilled hunter, a man who loved the outdoors. Jacob was an upright man who stayed at home.
Isaac preferred Esau. This is because he enjoyed eating the animals Esau killed. Rebecca preferred Jacob.
One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from hunting. He was hungry.
He said to Jacob: "I am starving! Give me some of that red stuff." That is why he was named Edom.
Jacob answered: "I will give it to you if you give me your birthright as the firstborn son."
Esau said: "All right! I am about to die. What good are rights as firstborn to me?"
Jacob answered: "First make a vow that you will give me your birthright." Esau made the vow and gave his rights as firstborn to Jacob.
Jacob gave him some bread and some of the soup. He ate and drank and then got up and left. Esau did not care about his birthright.
There was another famine in the land besides the earlier one during the time of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar.
Jehovah appeared to Isaac and said: "Isaac, stay away from Egypt! I will show you where I want you to go.
"You will live there as a foreigner. I will be with you and bless you. I will keep my promise to your father Abraham by giving this land to you and your descendants.
"I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky. I will give your descendants all of this land. They will be a blessing to every nation on earth.
"This is because Abraham did everything I told him to do."
Isaac moved to Gerar.
His wife Rebekah was very beautiful. He was afraid that someone might kill him to get her. So he told everyone that Rebekah was his sister.
After Isaac had been there a long time, King Abimelech looked out a window and saw Isaac intimately laughing and caressing Rebekah.
Abimelech called him in and said: "Rebekah must be your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?" "I thought someone would kill me," Isaac answered.
"Do you know what you have done?" Abimelech shouted. "If someone had slept with her, you would have made our whole nation guilty!"
So Abimelech charged all the people, saying: "He who touches this man or his wife will certainly be put to death."
Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. Jehovah blessed him.
He became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy.
He possessed flocks and herds and a great household. The Philistines envied him.
The Philistines stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father. They filled them with dirt.
Abimelech said to Isaac: "Go away from us. You are too powerful for us."
Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar where he settled.
Then Isaac dug the water wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham. The Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. He gave them the same names his father had given them.
Isaac’s servants dug in the valley wadi torrent-valley and found a well of running water.
The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac. They said: "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they argued with him.
They dug another well. And they quarreled over that one too. So Isaac named it Sitnah Accusation.
He moved on from there and dug another well. They did not quarrel over this one. So he named it Rehoboth Roomy. He said: "Now Jehovah has made room for us. We will prosper in this land."
He went from there to Beer-sheba.
That night Jehovah appeared to Isaac. Jehovah said: "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, because I am with you. I will bless you and increase the number of your descendants for my servant Abraham’s sake."
Isaac built an altar there and worshiped Jehovah. Then he set up his camp. His servants dug another well.
Abimelech came from Gerar with Ahuzzath, his friend companion, and Phicol, the commander of his army, to see Isaac.
Isaac asked: "Why have you now come to see me? You were so unfriendly to me before and made me leave your country."
They answered: "Now we know that Jehovah is with you. We think that there should be a solemn agreement between us. We want you to promise
"that you will not harm us. We did not harm you. We were kind to you and let you go peacefully. Now it is clear that Jehovah has blessed you."
Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
Early the next morning each man made his promise and sealed it with a vow. Isaac said good-bye to them. They parted as friends.
That day Isaac’s servants told him about the well they dug. They said: "We have found water."
Isaac named the well Shibah. The town is still called Beer-sheba.
When Esau was forty he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
These two women brought a lot of grief to his parents, Isaac and Rebekah.
Isaac was old and going blind. He called his older son Esau and said to him: "Son!" Esau answered: "Here I am."
Isaac said: "I am old. I do not know when I will die.
"Please take your hunting equipment, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open country and hunt some wild game for me.
"Prepare a good-tasting meal for me. Prepare it the way I like it. Bring it to me to eat so that I will bless you before I die."
Rebekah listened while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau. Esau went into the open country to hunt for some wild game to bring back.
Rebekah said to her son Jacob: "I have just heard your father speak to your brother Esau.
"He said: ‘ Bring me some wild game, and prepare a good-tasting meal for me to eat. Then I will bless you in the presence of Jehovah before I die. ’
"Now listen to me, Son, and do what I tell you.
"Go to the flock and pick out two fat young goats. I will cook them and make some of that food your father likes so much.
"You take it to him to eat. Then he will give you his blessing before he dies."
Jacob said to his mother: "You know that Esau is a hairy man. I have smooth skin.
"Perhaps my father will touch me and find out that I am deceiving him. That way, I will bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing."
His mother replied: "Let any curse against you fall on me, my son. Just do as I say, and go and get the goats for me."
So Jacob brought the meat to his mother. And she cooked the tasty food that his father liked.
Then she took Esau’s best clothes and dressed Jacob in them.
She also covered the smooth part of his hands and neck with goatskins.
She gave her son Jacob the good-tasting meal and the bread she had prepared.
He went to his father and said: "Father?" "Yes," he answered. "Who are you, Son?"
Jacob answered: "I am your older son Esau. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of the meat that I brought you. Then you can give me your blessing."
Isaac said: "How did you find it so quickly, son?" Jacob answered: "Jehovah your God helped me find it."
Isaac said to Jacob: "Please come closer. Let me touch you. Are you really Esau?"
Jacob went closer. His father touched him. He said: "You sound like Jacob, but your hands feel hairy like Esau’s."
So Isaac blessed Jacob, thinking he was Esau.
Isaac asked: "Are you really my son Esau?" "Yes, I am," Jacob answered.
So Isaac told him: "Serve me the wild meat. I can give you my blessing." Jacob gave him some meat, and he ate it. He also gave him some wine, and he drank it.
Then his father Isaac said to him: "Come close, my son, and kiss me."
He came close and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his garments. Then he blessed him and said: "See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field Jehovah has blessed."
"May God give you of the dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth, and an abundance of grain and new wine.
"May peoples serve you. And nations bow down to you. Be master of your brothers. And may your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you. Blessed be those who bless you."
No sooner had Isaac finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob left his presence, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
He also prepared a good-tasting meal and brought it to his father. Then he said to his father: "Please, Father, eat some of the meat I have hunted for you so that you will bless me."
"Who are you?" his father Isaac asked him. "I am your firstborn son, Esau," he answered.
Isaac began to tremble and shake all over. He asked: "Who was it, then, who killed an animal and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came. I gave him my final blessing, and so it is his forever."
When Esau heard this he cried out loudly and bitterly. He said: "Give me your blessing also, Father!"
Isaac responded: "Your brother deceived me. He has taken your blessing."
Esau said: "This is the second time that he has cheated me. No wonder his name is Jacob. He took my rights as the firstborn son. Now he has taken my blessing. Have you saved a blessing for me?"
Isaac answered: "I have already made him master over you. I have made all his relatives his slaves. I have given him grain and wine. Now there is nothing that I can do for you, son!"
Esau pleaded: "Father, please! Do you have only one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!" Esau broke down and wept.
Then Isaac said to him: "You will live off the land and what it yields.
"You will live by your sword. You will serve your brother. Soon you will become restless and break his yoke from your neck."
So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. Esau said to himself: "The days of mourning for my father are near. Then I will kill my brother Jacob."
When Rebekah heard about Esau’s plans to kill Jacob, she called her younger son, Jacob. She said: "Your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you.
"Go quickly, my son. Run away to my brother Laban in Haran.
"Stay with him until your brother’s anger cools down.
"When your brother’s anger is gone and he has forgotten what you did to him, I will let you know. Then you may come back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
Rebekah said to Isaac: "I cannot stand Hittite women! I would rather die than see Jacob marry one of them."
Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and told him: "Do not marry a Canaanite.
"Go to Mesopotamia instead, to the home of your grandfather Bethuel. Marry one of the young women there, one of your uncle Laban’s daughters.
"Almighty God will bless your marriage and give you many children. You will become the father of many nations!
"He will bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham. You may take possession of this land, in which you have lived and which God gave to Abraham!"
Isaac then sent Jacob to stay with Rebekah’s brother Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean.
Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and had warned him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. He also learned that Jacob had been sent to find a wife in northern Syria.
Jacob did as his father and mother said. He went to Paddan-aram.
It was clear to Esau that his father despised the local Canaanite women.
So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.
Jacob left Beer-sheba and traveled toward Haran.
As soon as the sun went down he stopped for the night. He took one of the stones from that place, put it under his head, and lay down there.
He had a dream in which he saw a stairway set up on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven. He saw the angels of God going up and coming down on it.
Jehovah was standing above the stairway. He proclaimed: "I am Jehovah, the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give the land on which you are lying to you and your descendants.
"Your descendants will be like the dust on the earth. You will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. Every family on earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants.
"Remember, I am with you. I will watch over you wherever you go. I will also bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I do what I have promised you."
Jacob woke up from his sleep and said: "Truly, Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it!"
He was filled with reverence. He said: "This is an awesome place! Certainly, this is the house of God and the gateway to the heavens!"
Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had under his head. He set it up as a marker and poured oil on top of it.
He named that place Bethel House of God. Previously, the name of the city was Luz.
Jacob made a vow. He said: "If God will be with me and will watch over me on my trip and give me food to eat and clothes to wear,
"and if I return safely to my father’s home, then Jehovah will be my God.
"This stone I placed as a marker will be the house of God. I will certainly give you a tenth of everything you give me."
Jacob continued on his trip and arrived at the land in the east.
Suddenly he came upon a well out in the fields. There were three flocks of sheep lying around it. The flocks were watered from this well. It had a large stone over the opening.
When all the flocks came together there, the shepherds would roll the stone back and water them. Then they would put the stone back in place.
Jacob asked the shepherds: "Where are you from?" They answered: "We are from Haran."
Then he asked: "Do you know Nahor’s grandson Laban?" "Yes, we do," they replied.
Jacob asked: "How is he?" They replied: "He is well. Here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep."
"It is still the heat of the day. It is not time for livestock to be gathered. Would you like to water the sheep so they can get back to grazing?"
They said: "We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well. Then we water the sheep."
While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
Jacob saw Rachel, daughter of his uncle Laban, with his uncle Laban’s sheep. He came forward and rolled the stone off the opening of the well and watered his uncle Laban’s sheep.
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.
Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s nephew and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.
As soon as Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him into his home. Then Jacob told Laban all that had happened.
Laban said: "You are indeed my own flesh and blood." Jacob stayed there a whole month.
Laban said to Jacob: "You should not work for me for nothing just because you are my relative. How much pay do you want?"
Laban had two daughters. The older was named Leah and the younger Rachel.
Leah had soft eyes and Rachel was shapely and very beautiful.
Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said: "I will work seven years for you, if you will let me marry Rachel."
Laban answered: "It is better that I give her to you than to anyone else. Stay here with me."
Jacob worked seven years for Laban. The time seemed like only a few days, because he loved Rachel so much.
Jacob said to Laban: "Give me my wife for the time is completed. I want to marry Rachel now!"
Laban gathered all the men of the place and gave a feast.
In the evening when it was dark, he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him. Jacob slept with her.
Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her maid.
"What have you done to me?" Jacob asked Laban: "Did I work for you in return for Rachel? Why did you cheat me?"
Laban answered: "It is not our custom to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
"Finish the week of wedding festivities with this daughter. Then we will give you the other one too. But you will have to work for me another seven years."
Jacob did that. He finished the week with Leah. Then Laban gave his daughter Rachel to him as his wife.
Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.
Jacob slept with Rachel too. He loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years.
Jehovah saw that Leah was loved less, so he made it possible for her to have children. But Rachel had none.
Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, because she said: "Certainly, Jehovah has seen my misery. Now my husband will love me!"
She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: "Certainly, Jehovah has heard that I am unloved. He has also given me this son." She named him Simeon.
She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: "Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have given him three sons." She named him Levi.
Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said: "This time I will praise Jehovah." So she named him Judah Praise. Then she stopped having children.
Rachel had not borne Jacob any children. As a result, she became jealous of her sister and said to Jacob: "Give me children, or I will die."
Jacob became angry with Rachel. He said: "I cannot take the place of God. He is the one who keeps you from having children."
She said: "Here is my maid Bilhah. Sleep with her, so that she can have a child for me. This way I can become a mother through her."
Then Rachel let Jacob marry Bilhah. Jacob slept with Bilhah.
They had a son.
Rachel named him Dan, because she said: "God has answered my prayers. He has vindicated me and given me a son."
Bilhah and Jacob had a second son.
Rachel said: "I have struggled hard with my sister, and I have won!" So she named the boy Naphtali.
When Leah realized she could not have any more children, she let Jacob marry her servant Zilpah.
They had a son.
Leah said: "How fortunate. She called him Gad."
Leah’s slave Zilpah gave birth to her second son for Jacob.
Leah said: "I am happy, for women will call me blessed. So she named him Asher."
During the wheat harvest Reuben went out into the fields. He found some mandrake plants. He brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah: "Please, give me some of your son’s mandrake plants."
Leah replied: "Is it not enough that you took my husband? Are you also going to take my son’s mandrake plants?" Rachel responded: "Very well, Jacob can go to bed with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrake plants."
Jacob came in from the fields that evening. Leah went out to meet him. "You are to sleep with me," she said. "You are my reward for my son’s mandrake plants." So he went to bed with her that night.
God answered Leah’s prayer. She became pregnant and gave birth to her fifth son for Jacob.
Leah said: "God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave to my husband." So she named him Issachar.
She became pregnant again and gave birth to her sixth son for Jacob.
Leah said: "God has presented me with a wonderful gift. This time my husband will honor me, because I have given him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
Later she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
Then God remembered Rachel. God listened to her and opened her womb.
So she conceived and gave birth to a son. She said: "God has taken away my reproach."
She named him Joseph. She said: "May Jehovah give me another son."
When Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban: "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.
"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you. Let me depart. For you know how much service I have done for you."
But Laban said: "If now it pleases you, stay with me. I have observed that Jehovah has blessed me on your account."
He continued: "Name your wages, and I will pay."
Jacob responded: "You know how much work I have done for you and what has happened to your livestock under my care.
"The little that you had before I came has grown to a large amount. Jehovah has blessed you wherever I have been. When may I do something for my own family?"
Laban asked: "What should I give you?" Jacob answered: "Do not give me anything. Instead, do something for me. Then I will go back to taking care of and watching your flocks again.
"Let me go through all of your flocks today and take every speckled and spotted sheep, every black lamb, and every spotted and speckled goat. They will be my wages.
"My honesty will speak for itself whenever you come to check on my wages. Any goat I have that is not speckled or spotted or any lamb that is not black will be considered stolen."
Laban answered: "I agree; we will do as you have said."
Laban took out the striped and spotted male goats, all the speckled and spotted female goats every one with white on it, and every black lamb. He had his sons take charge of them that same day.
They moved away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Laban’s flocks.
Jacob took green branches of poplar storax, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them.
He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink.
So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Laban’s flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Laban’s.
When the strongest of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods.
When the flock was feeble, he did not put them in. That way the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s.
He became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.
Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying: "Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father. He has gained all his wealth from him."
He also noticed that Laban did not appear as friendly to him as before.
Jehovah said to Jacob: "Go back to the land of your ancestors and to your relatives. I will be with you."
Then Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah to come out to the open country where his flocks were.
He said to them: "I have seen that your father’s attitude toward me is not as friendly as before. The God of my father has been with me.
"You both know that I have worked for your father with all my strength.
"Yet he has cheated me. He changed my wages ten times. However, God did not let him harm me."
"When Laban said, ‘ The speckled goats shall be your wages, ’ ’ all the flocks produced speckled young. When he said, ‘ The striped goats shall be your wages, ’ ’ all the flocks produced striped young.
"This way God has taken sheep and goats from your father and given them to me.
"Once, when the flocks were mating, I dreamed that all the rams were either spotted or speckled.
"Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘ Jacob. ’ ’ I said, here I am.
"He said, ‘ Look up and see, now please, that all the male goats that are mating are striped, speckled, or spotted, because I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you.
"‘ I am the God of Bethel. That is where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Arise and leave this land. Return to the land of your birth. ’"
Rachel and Leah asked: "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?
"Are we not accounted as foreigners by him? He sold us and also utterly consumed the price paid for us.
"For all the riches that God took away from our father belong to us and to our children. Do what God told you to do."
Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels.
When Laban went to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols.
Jacob also tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving.
He left in a hurry with all that belonged to him. He crossed the Euphrates River and went toward the mountains of Gilead.
Three days after he left, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
Laban took his men with him and pursued Jacob for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
In a dream that night God came to Laban. God said: "Be careful not to threaten Jacob in any way."
Jacob camped on a mountain. So when Laban caught up with Jacob as he was camped in the hill country of Gilead, he set up his camp not far from Jacod’s.
Laban said to Jacob: "Why did you deceive me and carry off my daughters like women captured in war?
"Why did you deceive me and slip away without telling me? If you had told me, I would have sent you on your way with rejoicing and singing to the music of tambourines and harps.
"You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters. This was a foolish thing you did.
"It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father came to me this night. He said, ‘ Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob. ’
"It appears that you are going because your heart’s desire is for your father’s house. But why have you taken my gods?"
Jacob answered Laban: "I was afraid you might take your daughters from me by force.
"As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death. Make a search in front of us all for what is yours, and take it." Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them.
So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there. He left Leah’s tent and went into Rachel’s.
Rachel took the images. She put them in the camels’ basket and was seated on them. Laban searched through the tent and did not find them.
Rachel said to her father: "Do not be angry, Father, but I cannot get up to greet you. I am having my period." So even though Laban had made a thorough search, he did not find the idols.
Jacob lost his temper. "What crime have I committed?" he asked angrily. "What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down?
"Now that you have searched through all my belongings, what household article have you found that belongs to you? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it. Let them decide which one of us is right.
"I have been with you now for twenty years. Your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce. I have not even eaten any rams from your flocks.
"I always absorbed the loss when wild animals killed a sheep. I did not take it to you to show that it was not my fault. You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night.
"Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep.
"I have been in your house twenty years! I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters. I kept your flock for six years. You changed my wages ten times.
"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, out of respect for Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed by now. God has seen my misery and hard work. Last night he made it right!"
Then Laban answered Jacob: "These are my daughters, my grandchildren, and my flocks. Everything you see is mine! Yet, what can I do today for my daughters or for their children?
"Now, let us make an agreement covenant and let it stand as a witness between you and me."
Jacob took a stone and set it up as a marker.
Jacob said to his relatives: "Gather some stones." They took stones, put them into a pile, and ate there by the pile of stones.
In his language, Laban called it "Jegar Sahadutha" Witness Pile, but Jacob called it "Galeed."
Laban said: "This pile of stones stands as a witness between you and me today." This is why it was named Galeed,
and also Mizpah Watchtower, because he said: "May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are unable to see each other.
"If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women behind my back, remember that God stands as a witness between you and me."
Laban also said to Jacob: "Here is the pile of stones. Here is the marker that I have set up between you and me.
"This pile of stones and this marker stand as witnesses that I will not go past the pile of stones to harm you, and that you will not go past the pile of stones or marker to harm me.
"May the God of Abraham and Nahor — the God of their father — judge between us." So Jacob swore this oath out of respect for his father Isaac.
He offered a sacrifice on the mountain. He invited his relatives to eat the meal with him. They ate with him and spent the night on the mountain.
Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and went back home.
Along the way God’s angels met Jacob.
When he saw them, Jacob said: "This is God’s camp!" He named that place Mahanaim.
Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in Seir, the country of Edom.
He informed them to say: "Your obedient servant, Jacob, reports to my master Esau that I have been staying with Laban and that I have delayed my return until now.
"I own cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and slaves. I am sending you word in the hope of gaining your favor."
When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said: "We went to your brother Esau. He is already on his way to meet you. He has four hundred men with him."
Jacob was frightened and worried. He divided the people who were with him into two groups. He also divided his sheep, goats, cattle, and camels.
He thought: "If Esau comes and attacks the first group, the other may be able to escape."
Then Jacob prayed: "O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, you said to me: ‘ Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you. ’
"I am less than nothing in comparison with all your love and your faithfulness to me your servant. I only had a stick in my hand when I traveled across Jordan. Now I have become two armies.
"Save me from the hand of Esau, my brother. I fear that he will attack me and kill both mothers and children.
"You said, ‘ I will make sure that you are prosperous and that your descendants will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. No one will be able to count them because there are so many. ’"
Jacob stayed there that night. Then he prepared a gift for his brother Esau from what he had brought with him:
He placed servants in charge of each herd. He said to his servants: "Go ahead of me, and maintain a distance between the herds."
He commanded the first servant: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, ‘ To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and whose animals are these ahead of you? ’
"Say, ‘ They belong to your servant Jacob. This is a gift sent to you. Jacob is directly behind us. ’"
He also commanded the second servant, the third, and all the others who followed the herds. He said: "Say the same thing to Esau when you find him.
"Be sure to say, ‘ Jacob is right behind us. ’" He thought: "I will make peace with him by giving him this gift that I am sending ahead of me. After that, I will see him, and he will welcome me back."
Jacob sent the gift ahead of him, while he stayed in the camp that night.
That same night Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two concubines, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok River.
After he sent them across, he also sent across all that he owned.
Then Jacob was by himself. A man was fighting with him till dawn.
The man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob. He gave him a blow in the hollow part of his thigh, so that his leg was damaged.
He said to him: "Let me go now, for the dawn is near." But Jacob said: "I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing."
Then he asked: "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
The man said: "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel He Struggles With God, because you have struggled with God and with men — and you have won."
Jacob said: "Please tell me your name." The man answered: "Why do you ask for my name?" Then he blessed Jacob there.
Jacob named that place Peniel Face of God, because he said: "I have seen God face to face, yet my life was saved."
The sun rose as he passed Penuel. He was limping because of his thigh.
Therefore, even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle of the thigh the sinew attached to the hip socket. This is because God touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh at the muscle.
Jacob saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. Therefore he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two concubines.
He put the concubines and their children first, then Leah and her children, and finally Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
Jacob went ahead of them. He bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
Esau ran to meet him. He threw his arms around him, and kissed him. They both cried.
Esau looked around and saw the women and the children. He asked: "Who are these people with you?" Jacob answered: "These are the children whom God has been good enough to give me."
Then the concubines came up with their children and bowed down.
Leah and her children came next, and last of all Joseph and Rachel came and bowed down.
Esau asked: "What about that other group I met? What do you mean by all this company?" Jacob answered: "It was to gain your favor."
"But, brother, I already have plenty," Esau replied. "Keep them for yourself."
Jacob said: "Please accept these gifts as a sign of your friendship for me. When you welcomed me and I saw your face, it was like seeing the face of God.
"Take my offering then, with my blessing. God has been very good to me and I have enough." So at his strong request, he took it.
Esau said: "Let us go on our journey together. I will go in front."
Jacob responded: "My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds that are nursing are a care to me. If they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die.
"Please let my lord pass on before his servant. I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir."
Esau said: "Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said: "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
Jacob moved on to Succoth. He built a house there for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is named Succoth.
Jacob traveled safely from Paddan-aram to the city of Shechem in Canaan. He camped within sight of the city.
He bought the piece of land on which he pitched his tents. He bought it from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of silver.
He set up an altar there and named it God, the God of Israel.
One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the Canaanite women.
Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, who was chief of that region, saw her. He grabbed her and raped sexually defiled her.
He found the young woman so attractive that he fell in love with her. So he tried to win her affection.
He told his father: "I want you to get Dinah for me as my wife."
Jacob learned that his daughter had been disgraced. Since his sons were out in the fields with his livestock, he did nothing until they came back.
Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
About that time Jacob’s sons were coming in from the fields. When they heard about it, they were shocked and furious that Shechem had done such a thing. He had insulted the people of Israel by raping Jacob’s daughter.
Hamor said to him: "My son Shechem has fallen in love with your daughter. Please let him marry her.
"Let us make an agreement that there will be intermarriage between our people and yours.
"Then you may stay here in our country with us. You may live anywhere you wish. You may trade freely and own property."
Shechem added: "Let me have your favor and I will give you whatever you want.
"Ask anything as the bride price, no matter how expensive. I will do anything. Just let me marry Dinah."
Jacob’s sons wanted to get even with Shechem and his father because of what happened to their sister.
So they tricked them by saying: "You are not circumcised! It would be a disgrace for us to let you marry Dinah now.
"But we will let you marry her, if you and the other men in your tribe get circumcised.
"Then we will give our daughters to you. And we will take your daughters for us. We will live with you as one people.
"But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go."
Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem.
The young man did not delay to do what was required. This was because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter. He was the most honored of all his family.
Hamor and his son Shechem went to their city gate to speak to the men of their city. They said:
"These people are friendly toward us. So let them live in our land and move about freely in the area. Look, there is plenty of room in this land for them. We can marry their daughters and let them marry ours.
"These people will consent to live with us and become one nation on one condition: Every male must be circumcised, as they are.
"Then all their livestock and everything else they own will be ours. So let us agree that they can live among us."
All the citizens of the city agreed with what Hamor and Shechem proposed. Then all the males were circumcised.
Three days later the men who had been circumcised were still weak from pain. So Simeon and Levi, two of Dinah’s brothers, attacked with their swords and killed every man in town.
They also killed Hamor and Shechem. Then they took Dinah and left.
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain. They plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled.
They took their flocks and their herds, their asses and whatever was in the city and in the field.
They captured their wives and all their little ones. They took all the wealth that was in their houses.
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: "You have brought trouble on me by making me loathsome to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Per ’ izzites. My numbers are few. If they gather themselves against me and attack my household I will be destroyed."
They responded: "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"
God said to Jacob: "Go to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar to God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
Jacob said to his family and those who were with him: "Get rid of the foreign gods that you have. Wash yourselves until you are ritually clean. Change your clothes.
"After that let us go to Bethel. I will make an altar there to God, who answered me when I was troubled and who has been with me wherever I have gone."
So everyone gave Jacob their idols and their earrings. He buried them under the oak big tree near Shechem.
Jacob and his family traveled through Canaan. God terrified the people in the towns so much that no one dared bother them.
Finally, they reached Bethel, also known as Luz.
Jacob built an altar there and called it God of Bethel. That was the place where God appeared to him when he was running from Esau.
Deborah died. She was the servant who cared for Rebekah from childhood. She was buried near Bethel, under the holy tree. They named it Allon-bacuth weeping tree.
God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram. He blessed him.
God said to him: "Your name is Jacob. You shall no longer be called Jacob. Israel shall be your name." Thus He called him Israel.
God also said: "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and an assembly of nations will come from you. Kings shall come forth from you.
"The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you. I will give the land to your descendants after you."
Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.
So Jacob set up a memorial, a stone marker, to mark the place where God had spoken with him. He poured a wine offering and olive oil on it.
Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel House of God.
After that they moved from Bethel. When there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. She had severe labor pains.
When one of her pains hit, the midwife said: "Do not be afraid. You have another son!"
Rachel was dying! With her last breath she named her son Ben-oni Son of My Sorrow, but his father named him Benjamin Son of My Right Hand.
Rachel died and was buried on the way to Bethlehem Ephrath.
Jacob set up a stone as a marker for her grave. The same marker is at Rachel’s grave today.
Israel moved on again. He pitched his tent by the tower of Eder.
While Israel lived in that region, Reuben went to bed with his father’s concubine Bilhah. Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons.
The sons of Leah were Jacob’s firstborn Reuben, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
The sons of Rachel’s slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
The sons of Leah’s slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were Jacob’s sons, who were born in Paddan-aram.
Jacob came home to his father Isaac, to Mamre’s city, Kiriath-arba Hebron. Abraham and Isaac had lived there for a while.
Isaac was one hundred and eighty years old.
Isaac took his last breath and died. He joined his ancestors in death at a very old age. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
This is the genealogy of Esau, who is Edom, and his descendants.
Esau selected his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel.
And Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the persons of his household, his cattle and all his animals, and all his goods which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a country away from the presence of his brother Jacob.
For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were strangers could not support them because of their livestock.
So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
This is the genealogy of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.
These were the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah, the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau.
These were the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah, and the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
These were the sheiks chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,
Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. They were the sons of Adah.
These were the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
These were the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs who descended from Oholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah.
These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these were their chiefs.
These were the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister was Timna.
These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
These were the sons of Zibeon: both Aiah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.
These the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
These were the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,
Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel:
These were the names of the sheiks chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,
Jacob continued to live in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived.
This is the story of Jacob and his descendants. Joseph was a seventeen-year-old young man. He took care of the flocks with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph told his father about the bad things his brothers were doing.
Jacob Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because Joseph had been born in Israel’s old age. So he made Joseph a special multicolored robe with long sleeves.
Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them. They hated Joseph and could not speak to him in a friendly way.
One time Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about it and they hated him even more.
He said: "Please listen to the dream I had.
"We were all in the field tying up sheaves of wheat. My sheaf got up and stood up straight. Yours formed a circle around mine and bowed down to it."
"Do you think you are going to be a king and rule over us?" his brothers asked. So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of what he said about them.
Joseph had another dream and told his brothers: "I had another dream, in which I saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me."
He also told the dream to his father. His father scolded him. "What kind of a dream is that? Do you think that your mother, your brothers, and I are going to come and bow down to you?"
Joseph’s brothers were jealous of him. His father kept thinking about the whole matter.
His brothers went to Shechem to take care of their father’s flock.
His father Jacob said to him: "I want you to go to your brothers. They are with the sheep near Shechem." "Yes, I will go," Joseph answered.
His father said: "Go and find out how your brothers and the sheep are doing. Then come back and let me know." So he sent him from Hebron Valley. Joseph was near Shechem,
and wandering through the fields, when a man asked: "What are you looking for?"
Joseph answered: "I am looking for my brothers who are watching the sheep. Can you tell me where they are?"
"They are not here anymore," the man replied. "I heard them say they were going to Dothan." Joseph soon found his brothers in Dothan.
Before he arrived, they saw him coming and made plans to kill him.
They said to one another: "Look, here comes the hero of those dreams!
"Let us kill him and throw him into a water pit. We can say that some wild animal ate him. Then we will see what happens to those dreams."
Reuben heard this and tried to protect Joseph from them. "Let us not kill him," he said.
"Do not murder him or even harm him. Just throw him into a dry well out here in the desert." Reuben planned to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
When Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his fancy coat.
They put him into a water pit. It had no water in it.
As they sat down to eat, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying the materials for cosmetics, medicine, and embalming. They were on their way to take them to Egypt.
Judah asked his brothers: "What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up his death?
"Let us sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let us not hurt him, because he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.
Some of the Midianite traders approached. The brothers pulled Joseph out of the well and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites. They took him to Egypt.
Reuben came back to the pit and found that Joseph was not there. He tore his clothes in sorrow.
He returned to his brothers and said: "The boy is not there! What am I going to do?"
Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph’s robe in its blood.
They took the robe to their father and said: "We found this. Does it belong to your son?"
He recognized it and said: "Yes, it is his! Some wild animal has killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!"
Jacob tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. He mourned for his son a long time.
All his sons and daughters came to comfort him. However, he refused to be comforted. He said: "I will go down to the grave still mourning for my son." So he continued to mourn for his son Joseph.
Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of the king’s officers, who was the captain of the palace guard.
At that time Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah, who was from the town of Adullam.
Judah met a young Canaanite woman there whose father was named Shua. He married her.
Shua bore him a son, whom he named Er.
She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son and named him Onan.
She had another son and named him Shelah. Judah was at Achzib when the boy was born.
For his first son Er, Judah got a wife whose name was Tamar.
Er was an evil man. It displeased Jehovah. So Jehovah killed him.
Then Judah said to Er’s brother Onan: "Go sleep with your brother’s widow. Fulfill your obligation to her as her husband’s brother. That way your brother may have descendants."
Onan knew that the children would not belong to him. So when he had intercourse with his brother’s widow, he let the semen spill on the ground, assuring that there would be no children for his brother.
What he did displeased Jehovah. So Jehovah killed him also.
Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar: "Return to your father’s house and remain a widow until my son Shelah grows up." He said this because he was afraid that Shelah would be killed, as his brothers had been. So Tamar went back home.
After some time Judah’s wife died. When he finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah of Adullam went to Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared.
Tamar found out that her father-in-law Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep.
She realized that Shelah was now a grown man. She had not been allowed to marry him. So she decided to dress in something other than her widow’s clothes and to cover her face with a veil. Then she sat outside the town of Enaim on the road to Timnah.
Judah came along. He did not recognize her because of the veil. He thought she was a prostitute,
and asked her to sleep with him. She asked: "What will you give me if I do?"
He answered: "One of my young goats." Then she asked: "What will you give me to keep until you send the goat?"
"What do you want?" he asked. "The ring on that cord around your neck," she replied. "I also want the special walking stick you have with you." So he gave them to her. They slept together and she became pregnant.
After returning home, Tamar took off the veil and dressed in her widow’s clothes again.
Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand. But he did not find her.
He asked the men: "Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?" They said: "There has been no temple prostitute here."
So he went back to Judah and said: "I did not find her. Besides, the men who lived there said there has not been any temple prostitute here."
Then Judah said: "Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you did not find her."
Three months later Judah was told: "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." Judah said: "Bring her out and have her burned to death!"
As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. She added: "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."
Judah recognized them and said: "She is more righteous than I, since I would not give her to my son Shelah." He did not sleep with her again.
When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand. The midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said: "This one came out first."
When he drew back his hand, his brother came out. She said: "So this is how you have broken out!" He was named Perez.
Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.
Joseph had been taken to Egypt. Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s Egyptian officials and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
Jehovah was with Joseph. Joseph became a successful man. He worked in the house of his Egyptian master.
Joseph’s master saw that Jehovah was with him. Jehovah made him succeed in everything he did.
Potiphar was pleased with him and made him his personal servant. He put him in charge of his house and everything he owned.
Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s household and everything he had in his house and in his fields because of Joseph.
Potiphar turned over everything he had to the care of Joseph. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Joseph was well built and good-looking.
Soon his master’s wife began to desire Joseph and asked him to go to bed with her.
He refused, and said to her: "My master does not have to concern himself with anything in the house, because I am here. He has put me in charge of everything he has.
"No one in this house is greater than I. He has kept nothing back from me except you. You are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?"
She kept asking Joseph day after day. He refused to go to bed with her or be with her.
One day he went into the house to do his work. None of the household servants were there.
She grabbed him by his coat and said: "Come to bed with me!" But he ran outside and left his coat in her hand.
When she realized that he had gone but had left his coat behind,
she called her household servants and said to them: "Look! My husband brought this Hebrew here to fool around with us. He came in and tried to go to bed with me. I screamed as loud as I could.
"When he heard me scream, he ran out of the house, leaving his coat with me."
Potiphar’s wife kept Joseph’s coat until her husband came home.
She said: "That Hebrew slave of yours tried to rape me!
"When I screamed for help, he left his coat and ran out of the house."
Potiphar became very angry
and threw Joseph in the same prison where the king’s prisoners were kept. While Joseph was in prison,
Jehovah helped him and was good to him. He even made the jailer like Joseph so much that
he put him in charge of the other prisoners and of everything that was done in the jail.
The jailer did not worry about anything, because Jehovah was with Joseph and made him successful in all that he did.
The king’s chief cupbearer and his chief baker made the king angry.
Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard. It was the same place where Joseph was imprisoned.
The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph. He took care of them. After they had been confined for some time,
both prisoners, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, had dreams one night. Each man had a dream with its own special meaning.
Joseph saw that they were upset when he came to them in the morning.
He asked these officials of Pharaoh who were with him in his master’s prison: "Why do you look so unhappy today?"
"We both had dreams," they answered him, "but there is no one to tell us what they mean." "Is it not God who can tell what dreams mean?" Joseph asked them. "Tell me all about them."
So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said: "In my dream a grapevine with three branches appeared in front of me.
"Soon after it sprouted it blossomed. Then its clusters ripened into grapes.
"Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand. I took the grapes and squeezed them into it. I put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand."
"This is what it means," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days.
"In the next three days Pharaoh will release you and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
"Remember me when things go well for you. Please do me a favor. Mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison.
"I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews. And here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon."
When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph: "I also saw in my dream three baskets of white bread on my head.
"The top basket contained all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh. The birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
Joseph answered: "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
"In three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you. He will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you."
It happened on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday that he made a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
He did indeed hang the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph. In fact he forgot him.
Two years later Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamed he was standing by the Nile River.
Suddenly, seven nice-looking well-fed cows came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.
Seven other cows came up from the river behind them. These cows were sickly and skinny. They stood behind the first seven cows on the riverbank.
The cows that were sickly and skinny ate the seven nice-looking well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
He fell asleep again and had another dream. Seven heads of grain, full and ripe, were growing on one stalk.
Then seven other heads of grain sprouted thin and scorched by the desert wind.
The thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. The king woke up and realized that he had been dreaming.
The king was upset the next morning. So he called his magicians and wise men and told them what he had dreamed. None of them could tell him what the dreams meant.
The king’s chief cupbearer said: "Now I remember what I was supposed to do.
"When you were angry with your chief cook and me, you threw us both in jail in the house of the captain of the guard.
"One night we both had dreams. Each dream had a different meaning.
"A young Hebrew, who was a servant of the captain of the guard, was there with us at the time. When we told him our dreams, he explained what each of them meant.
"Everything happened just as he said it would. I got my job back, and the cook was put to death."
So the king sent for Joseph. He was quickly brought out of jail. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to the king.
The king said: "I had a dream. No one can explain what it means. I am told that you can interpret dreams."
Joseph then answered Pharaoh: "I cannot do it myself, but God can give the meaning of your dreams."
The king told Joseph: "I dreamed as I stood on the bank of the Nile River,
"I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river. They began feeding on the grass.
"Next, seven skinny, bony cows came up out of the river. I have never seen such terrible looking cows anywhere in Egypt.
"The skinny cows ate the fat ones!
"Even though they had eaten the fat cows, no one could tell they had eaten them. They looked just as sick as before. Then I woke up.
"In my second dream I saw seven good, full heads of grain growing on a single stalk.
"Seven other heads of grain, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted behind them.
"The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but no one could tell me what it meant."
Joseph said to Pharaoh: "Pharaoh had the same dream twice. God has told Pharaoh what he is going to do.
"The seven good cows are seven years. The seven good heads of grain are seven years. It is all the same dream.
"The seven thin, sickly cows that came up behind them are seven years. The seven empty heads of grain scorched by the east wind are also seven years. Seven years of famine are coming!
"It is just as I said to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is going to do.
"Seven years are coming when there will be plenty of food in Egypt.
"Seven years of famine will follow. Then people will forget that there was plenty of food in Egypt. The famine will ruin the land.
"People will not remember that there was once plenty of food in the land, because the coming famine will be so severe.
"The reason Pharaoh has had a recurring dream is because the matter has been definitely decided by God. He will do it very soon.
"Pharaoh should look for a wise and intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt.
"Make arrangements to appoint supervisors over the land. Take a fifth of Egypt’s harvest during the seven good years.
"Have them collect all the food during these good years. Store up grain under Pharaoh’s control, to be kept for food in the cities.
"This food will be a reserve supply for our country during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt. Then the land will not be ruined by the famine."
The king and his officials approved this plan,
and he said to them: "We will never find a better man than Joseph. He is a man who has God’s Spirit in him."
The king said to Joseph: "God has shown you all this. Therefore it is obvious that you have greater wisdom and insight than anyone else.
"I will put you in charge of my country. All my people will obey your orders. Your authority will be second only to mine.
"I now appoint you governor over all Egypt."
Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand. He clothed him in garments of fine linen and put the gold necklace around his neck.
He had him ride in his second chariot. They proclaimed before him: "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph: "Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
Pharaoh named Joseph, Zaphenath-paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.
During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundantly.
He gathered all the food of these seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt and placed the food in the cities. He placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.
Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea. He finally stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.
Before the year of famine came, there were born to Joseph two sons, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh, because God helped him forget all his troubles and all about his father’s family.
He named the second son Ephraim, because God made him fruitful in the land where he had suffered.
The seven years when there was plenty of food in Egypt came to an end.
The seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every other country, but there was food throughout Egypt.
When the Egyptians became hungry, they cried out to the king for food. So he ordered them to go to Joseph and do what he told them.
The famine grew worse and spread over the entire country. Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians.
People came to Egypt from all over the world to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons: "Why are you doing nothing?"
He said: "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us from that place, so that we may live and not die."
Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt to buy grain.
Jacob would not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with the other brothers. He was afraid that something would happen to him.
Israel’s sons left with the others who were going to buy grain. This is because there was also famine in Canaan.
As governor of the country, Joseph was selling grain to everyone. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed in front of him with their faces touching the ground.
Joseph recognized his brothers the moment he saw them. Even so, he acted as if he did not know them and spoke harshly to them: "Where did you come from?" They answered: "From Canaan, to buy food."
Even though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
He remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them and said: "You are spies! You have come to find out where our country is weak."
"No!" they answered. "We have come as your slaves, to buy food.
"We are all brothers. We are not spies. We are honest men."
Joseph said to them: "No! You have come to find out where our country is weak."
They said: "Sir, we were twelve brothers in all, sons of the same man in the land of Canaan. One brother is dead, and the youngest is now with our father."
"It is just as I said," Joseph answered. "You are spies.
"This is how you will be tested: I swear by the name of the king that you will never leave unless your youngest brother comes here.
"One of you must go and get him. The rest of you will be kept under guard until the truth of what you say can be tested. Otherwise, as sure as the king lives, you are spies."
He put all of them together in prison for three days.
On the third day, Joseph said: "Do this and live, for I too respect God.
"If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in prison. Concerning the rest of you, carry grain for the famine of your households,
"and bring your youngest brother to me. We will verify your words and you will not die." They complied.
They said to one another: "Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw his distress when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us."
Reuben said: "Did I not tell you? Did I say, ‘ Do not sin against the boy ’? You would not listen! Now comes the reckoning for his blood."
They did not know that Joseph understood. There was an interpreter between them.
He turned away from them and wept. When he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man’s money in his sack. They were to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them.
They loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
They stopped for the night. One of them opened his sack to feed his donkey and his money was right inside his sack.
He said to his brothers: "My money has been put back! It is right here in my sack!" They wanted to die. They trembled and turned to each other and asked: "What has God done to us?"
They came to their father Jacob in Canaan. Then they told him all that had happened to them. They said:
"The governor of that land spoke harshly to us and treated us like spies."
We told him: "We are honest men, not spies.
"We were twelve brothers, sons of the same father. One is no longer with us. The youngest brother stayed with our father in Canaan.
"The governor of that land said to us, ‘ This is how I will know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me. Take food for your starving families and go.
"‘ But bring me your youngest brother. Then I will know that you are not spies but honest men. I will give your brother back to you, and you will be able to move about freely in this country. ’"
As they were emptying their sacks, each man found his bag of money in his sack. When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were frightened.
Their father Jacob said to them: "You are going to make me lose all my children! Joseph is no longer with us. Simeon is no longer with us. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"
So Reuben said to his father: "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Let me take care of him. I will bring him back to you."
Jacob replied: "My son will not go with you. His brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If any harm comes to him on the trip you are taking, the grief would drive this gray-haired old man to his grave!"
The famine was extremely bad in the land.
When they finished eating the grain they brought from Egypt, Israel said to his sons: "Go back and buy us a little more food."
Judah said to him: "The man gave us strict warning! He said: ‘ You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you. ’
"If you let our brother go with us, we will go and buy food for you.
‘ "If you will not let him go, we will not go. The man said to us: ‘ You will not be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you. ’"
Israel asked: "Why have you made trouble for me by telling the man you had another brother?"
They answered: "The man kept asking about our family and us. He asked, ‘ Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? ’ ’ We simply answered his questions. How could we possibly know he would say, ‘ Bring your brother here ’?"
Then Judah said to his father Israel: "Send the boy along with me. Let us get going so that we will not starve to death.
"I guarantee that he will come back. You can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and place him here in front of you, you can blame me the rest of my life.
"If we had not waited so long, we could have made this trip twice by now."
Their father Israel said: "If that is the way it has to be, then take the man a gift. Put some of the best products of the land in your bags. Take a little balm, a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
"Take twice as much money with you, because you must take back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake.
"Take your brother and return at once.
"May God Almighty cause the man to have pity on you, so that he will give Benjamin and your other brother back to you. As for me, if I must lose my children, I must lose them."
So the brothers took the gifts and twice as much money, and set out for Egypt with Benjamin. There they presented themselves to Joseph.
He saw Benjamin and told the servant in charge of his house: "Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and cook it, so they can eat with me at noon."
The servant did as he was told. He took the brothers to Joseph’s house.
On the way they were worried and started talking: "We are being taken there because of the money that was put back in our sacks last time. He will arrest us and take our donkeys. He will make us his slaves!"
When they arrived at Joseph’s house, they said to the servant in charge:
"We came to Egypt once before to buy grain.
"When we stopped for the night, we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid. We have brought that money back.
"We brought enough money to buy more grain. We do not know who put the money in our sacks."
"It is all right," the servant replied. "Do not worry. The God you and your father worship must have put the money there, because your money came first to me." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
The servant took them into Joseph’s house. He gave them water to wash their feet. He also tended their donkeys.
The brothers prepared their gifts so they could give them to Joseph at noon. For they had heard they were going to eat there.
Joseph came home and they gave him the gifts they had brought. They bowed down to him.
Joseph asked how they were. He said: "What about your elderly father? Is he still alive?"
They answered: "Your servant our father is still alive and well." Again they bowed down to Joseph.
Joseph looked around and saw his brother Benjamin. He said: "This must be the youngest brother you told me about. God bless you, my son."
Right away he rushed off to his room and cried because of his love for Benjamin.
After washing his face and returning, he was able to control himself. He said: "Serve the meal!"
Joseph was served at a table by himself. His brothers were served at another. The Egyptians sat at yet another table. This is because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews.
To the surprise of Joseph’s brothers, they were seated in front of him according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest.
They were served food from Joseph’s table. And Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others. So Joseph’s brothers drank with him and had a good time.
Later, Joseph told the servant in charge of his house: "Fill the men’s grain sacks with as much as they can hold and put their money in the sacks.
"Also put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother." The servant did as he was told.
When it was light the men took their donkeys and left.
They just left the city and were not far off, when Joseph said to the man in charge of his house: "Follow the men and when you overtake them, say to them: ‘ Why have you repaid evil for good?
"‘ Is this the cup that my master drinks from and that he uses for telling the future? What you have done is evil! ’"
When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.
They answered him: "What do you mean, Sir, by talking like this? We swear that we have done no such thing.
"You know that we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in the top of our sacks. Why should we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
"If you find that one of us has the cup, then kill him. The rest of us will become your slaves."
"Good!" the man replied. "I would do what you have said. But only the one who has the cup will become my slave. The rest of you can go free."
Each of the brothers quickly put his sack on the ground and opened it.
Joseph’s servant started searching the sacks. They began with the one that belonged to the oldest brother. When he came to Benjamin’s sack, he found the cup.
This upset the brothers so much that they began tearing their clothes in sorrow. Then they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
When Judah and his brothers got there, Joseph was still at home. So they bowed down to Joseph.
He asked them: "What have you done? Did you not know I could find out?"
"Sir, what can we say?" Judah replied. "How can we prove we are innocent? God has shown that we are guilty. And now all of us are your slaves, especially the one who had the cup."
He said: "It is far from me that I should do this. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant. As for you, you go in peace to your father."
Judah went up to Joseph and said: "Please, Sir, let me speak openly with you. Do not be angry with me, although you are equal to Pharaoh.
"Sir, you asked us, ‘ Do you have a father or a brother? ’
"We answered, ‘ We have a father who is old and a younger brother born to him when he was already old. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him. ’
‘ Then you said to us, ‘ Bring him here to me so that I can see him myself. ’
"We replied, ‘ The boy cannot leave his father. If the boy leaves him, his father will die. ’
"Then you said you will not be admitted to my presence again unless your youngest brother comes with you. ’
"We went back and told our father what you said.
"He told us to return and buy a little food.
"We answered, ‘ We cannot go. We will not be admitted to the man’s presence unless our youngest brother is with us. We can go only if our youngest brother also goes. ’
"Our father said, ‘ You know that my wife Rachel bore me only two sons.
"‘ One has already left me. He must have been torn to pieces by wild animals, because I have not seen him since he left.
"‘ If you take this one from me now and something happens to him, the sorrow you would cause me would kill me, as old as I am. ’
"That is why Benjamin must be with us when I go back to my father. He loves him so much
"I promised my father I would bring him home safely. If I do not, I told my father he could blame me the rest of my life.
"Sir, I am your slave. Please let me stay here in place of Benjamin. Please let him return home with his brothers.
"How can I face my father if Benjamin is not with me? I could not bear to see my father in such sorrow."
Joseph could no longer control himself in front of those standing near him. He sent them out of the room and when he was alone with his brothers he made himself known to them. Joseph could no longer control his feelings in front of his servants. He sent them out of the room. When he was alone with his brothers, he told them: "I am Joseph!"
He cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him. In fact, Pharaoh’s household heard about it.
Joseph said to his brothers: "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" His brothers could not answer him because they were afraid of him.
"Please come closer to me," Joseph said to his brothers. They came closer. He said: "I am Joseph, the brother you sold into slavery in Egypt!
"Dear brothers, do not be sad or angry with yourselves that you sold me. God sent me ahead of you to save lives.
"The famine has been in the land for two years. There will be five more years without plowing or harvesting.
"God sent me ahead of you to make sure that you would have descendants on the earth, and to save your lives in an amazing way.
"It was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh. He made me lord over his entire household, and ruler of Egypt.
"Hurry back to my father and tell him, ‘ This is what your son Joseph says: "God has made me lord of Egypt. Come here to me immediately!
"‘ "Live in the land of Goshen. You will be near me. Live there with your children and your grandchildren, as well as your flocks, your herds, and everything you have.
"‘ "I will provide for you in Egypt. For there will be five more years of famine. Then you, your family, and all who belong to you will not lose all that you have." ’
"You and my brother Benjamin can see for yourselves that I am the one who is speaking to you.
"You must tell my father of my entire splendor in Egypt. Tell him all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here."
Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck huged his brother and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.
He kissed all his brothers and wept on them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
When the news reached the palace that Joseph’s brothers had come, the king and his officials were pleased.
The king said to Joseph: "Tell your brothers to load their animals and to return to the land of Canaan.
"Have them get their father and their families and come back here. I will give them the best of the land in Egypt. They will have more than enough to live on.
"Tell them to take wagons with them from Egypt to bring their wives and small children and to bring their father with them.
"They should not worry about leaving their possessions behind. The best in the whole land of Egypt will be theirs."
The sons of Israel did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons filled with food for the trip, as the king had ordered.
Joseph gave some new clothes to each of his brothers. He gave Benjamin five new outfits and three hundred pieces of silver.
To his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the best things in Egypt. And ten other donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other food for the return trip.
Then he sent his brothers off and told them: "Do not argue on the way home!"
Joseph’s brothers left Egypt. When they arrived in Canaan,
they told their father that Joseph was still alive and was the ruler of Egypt. But their father was so surprised that he could not believe them.
Then they told him everything Joseph said. When he saw the wagons Joseph had sent, he felt much better.
He said: "Now I can believe you! My son Joseph must really be alive. I will get to see him before I die."
Jacob Israel packed up everything he owned and left for Egypt. On the way he stopped near the town of Beer-sheba and offered sacrifices to the God his father Isaac had worshiped.
That night, God spoke to him and said: "Jacob! Jacob!" "Here I am," Jacob answered.
God said: "I am God! I am the same God your father worshiped. Do not be afraid to go to Egypt. I will give you so many descendants that one day they will become a nation.
"I will go to Egypt with you. I will make sure you come back again. Joseph will close your eyes when you die."
Jacob left Beer-sheba. Israel’s sons put their father Jacob, their children, and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to bring him back.
They took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan. Jacob and all his family arrived in Egypt.
He brought his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters, his entire family.
These are the names of Israel’s descendants Jacob and his descendants who arrived in Egypt. Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn.
The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. Er and Onan died in Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.
The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
These were the sons Leah gave to Jacob in Paddan-aram, in addition to his daughter Dinah. The total number of these sons and daughters was thirty-three.
The sons of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
The sons of Asher were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel.
These were the descendants of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She gave birth to these children for Jacob. The total was sixteen.
The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest from the city of On.
The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob. The total was fourteen.
The son of Dan was Hushim.
The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
These were the descendants of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She gave birth to these sons for Jacob. The total was seven.
The total number of Jacob’s direct descendants who went with him to Egypt was sixty-six. This did not include the wives of Jacob’s sons.
Joseph had two sons who were born in Egypt. There were a total of seventy people in Jacob’s household who went to Egypt.
Jacob sent Judah ahead to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen. When they arrived,
Joseph got in his chariot and went to Goshen to meet his father. When they met, Joseph threw his arms around his father’s neck and cried for a long time.
Jacob said to Joseph: "Now I am ready to die. Now that I have seen you and know that you are still alive."
Joseph said to his brothers and the rest of his father’s family: "I must go and tell the king that my brothers and all my father’s family, who were living in Canaan, have come to me.
"I will tell him that you are shepherds and take care of livestock. And that you have brought your flocks and herds and everything else that belongs to you.
"The king will call for you. He will ask what your occupation is.
"Be sure to tell him that you have taken care of livestock all your lives, just as your ancestors did. In this way he will let you live in the region of Goshen. Joseph said this because Egyptians will have nothing to do with shepherds consider shepherds loathsome.
Joseph took five of his brothers and went to the king. He told him: "My father and my brothers have come from Canaan with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own. They are now in the region of Goshen."
Then he presented his brothers to the king.
The king asked: "What is your occupation?" "We are shepherds, Sir, just as our ancestors were," they answered.
"We have come to live in this country. The famine is so severe in the land of Canaan that there is no pasture for our flocks. Please give us permission to live in the region of Goshen."
The king said to Joseph: "Now that your father and your brothers have arrived,
"the land of Egypt is theirs. Let them settle in the region of Goshen, the best part of the land. If there are any capable men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock."
Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing.
The king asked him: "How old are you?"
Jacob answered: "My life of wandering has lasted a hundred and thirty years. Those years have been few and difficult, unlike the long years of my ancestors in their wanderings."
Jacob gave the king a farewell blessing and left.
Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt. He gave them property in the best of the land near the city of Rameses. This was as the king had commanded.
Joseph provided food for his father, his brothers, and all the rest of his father’s family, including the very youngest.
The famine was so severe that there was no food anywhere. The people of Egypt and Canaan became weak with hunger.
They bought grain from Joseph. Joseph collected all the money and took it to the palace.
When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was spent, the Egyptians came to Joseph and said: "Give us food! Do not let us die. Do something! Our money is all gone."
Joseph answered: "Bring your livestock. I will give you food in exchange for it if your money is all gone."
They brought their livestock to Joseph. He gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. That year he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
The following year they said to him: "We will not hide the fact from you, Sir, that our money is all gone and our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left to give you except our bodies and our lands.
"Do not let us die. Do something! Do not let our fields be deserted. Buy us and buy our land in exchange for food. We will be the king’s slaves. He will own our land. Give us grain to keep us alive and seed so that we can plant our fields."
Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for the king. Every Egyptian was forced to sell his land, because the famine was so severe. All the land became the king’s property.
He Joseph removed the people into the cities from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other.
The only land he did not buy was the land that belonged to the priests. The king gave the priests an allowance to live on. So they did not have to sell their lands.
Joseph said to the people: "I have now bought you and your lands for the king. Here is seed for you to sow in your fields.
"You must give one-fifth to the king at the time of harvest. You can use the rest for seed and for food for yourselves and your families."
They answered: "You have saved our lives. You have been good to us. We will be the king’s slaves."
Joseph made it a law for the land of Egypt that one-fifth of the harvest should belong to the king. This law still remains in force today. Only the lands of the priests did not become the king’s property.
The Israelites lived in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They became rich and had many children.
Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, until he was a hundred and forty-seven years old.
When the time drew near for him to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him: "Place your hand under my thighs and make a solemn vow that you will not bury me in Egypt.
"I want to be buried where my fathers are. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried." Joseph answered: "I will do as you say."
Jacob said: "Make a vow that you will." Joseph made the vow. Jacob gave thanks there on his bed.
Later Joseph was told that his father was ill. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see Jacob.
Jacob was told that his son Joseph had come to see him. He gathered his strength and sat up in bed.
Jacob said to Joseph: "Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.
"He promised: ‘ I will give you a large family with many descendants that will grow into a nation. I am giving you this land that will belong to you and your family from generation to generation. ’" Hebrew: olam olam long lasting possession
Jacob went on to say: "Joseph, your two sons Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt. But I accept them as my own, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
"Any children you have later will be considered yours. Their inheritance will come from Ephraim and Manasseh.
"Your mother Rachel died in Canaan after we left northern Syria and before we reached Bethlehem. I had to bury her along the way."
Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons. He asked Joseph: "Who are these boys?" Joseph answered:
"They are my sons. God has given them to me here in Egypt." "Bring them to me," Jacob said. "I want to give them my blessing." Joseph brought the boys to him.
Israel’s eyesight was failing because of old age. He could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to his father. Israel hugged them and kissed them.
Israel said to Joseph: "I never expected to see you again. Now God has even let me see your sons."
Joseph took them off his father’s lap and bowed with his face touching the ground.
Then Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right, facing Israel’s left, and Manasseh on his left, facing Israel’s right, and brought them close to him.
But Israel crossed his hands and reached out. He put his right hand on Ephraim’s head, although Ephraim was the younger son. He put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was older.
Jacob blessed Joseph. He said: "May God, in whose presence my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac walked, may this God who has been my shepherd all my life to this very day,
"May the being who rescued me from all evil bless these boys! May they be called by my name and by the names of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac. May they have many children on the earth."
Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on Ephraim’s head. Joseph did not like it. So he took his father’s hand in order to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.
He said to his father: "That is not right, Father! This is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head."
His father refused and said: "I know, Son, I know! Manasseh, too, will become a nation. He, too, will be important. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be more important than he. His descendants will become many nations."
That day he blessed them. He said: "Because of you, Israel will speak this blessing: ‘ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh! ’ ’ In this way Israel put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh."
Then Israel said to Joseph: "I am about to die. God will be with you. He will bring you back to the land of your fathers.
"I am giving you one more mountain ridge than your brothers. I took it from the Amorites with my own sword and bow."
Jacob called for his sons. He said: "Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the future.
"Come together and listen, sons of Jacob. Listen to your father Israel.
"Reuben, you are my firstborn; you are my strength and the first child of my manhood. You are the proudest and strongest of all my sons.
"You are like a raging flood. But you will not be the most important, for you slept with my concubine. You dishonored your father’s bed.
"Simeon and Levi are brothers. They use their weapons to commit violence.
"I will not join in their secret talks. I will not take part in their meetings. They killed people in anger. They crippled bulls for sport.
"A curse is on their anger, because it is so fierce. And a curse is on their fury, because it is so cruel. I will scatter them throughout the land of Israel. I will disperse them among its people.
"Judah, your brothers will praise you. You hold your enemies by the neck. Your brothers will bow down before you.
"Judah is like a lion, killing his victim and returning to his den. He is like a lion stretching out and lying down. No one dares disturb him.
"The royal scepter shall not depart from Judah. His descendants will always rule. Nations will bring him tribute and bow in obedience before him. This, until Shiloh comes and all will obey him.
"He will tie his donkey to a grapevine, his colt to the best vine. He will wash his clothes in wine, his garments in the blood of grapes.
"His eyes are darker than wine. His teeth are whiter than milk.
"Zebulun will live by the coast. He will have ships by the coast. His border will go as far as Sidon.
"Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the saddlebags.
"When he sees that his resting place is good and that the land is pleasant, he will bend his back to the burden and will become a slave laborer.
"Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
"Dan will be a snake on a road, a viper on a path that bites a horse’s heels so that its rider falls backwards.
"I wait with hope for your salvation, O Jehovah.
"Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders. He will strike back at their heels.
"Asher’s food will be rich. He will provide delicacies fit for a king.
"Naphtali is a deer set free with beautiful fawns words.
"Joseph is a fruitful tree, a fruitful tree by a spring, with branches climbing over a wall.
"Archers provoked him, shot at him, and harassed him.
"His bow stayed steady! His arms remained limber because of the help of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
"because of the God of your father who helps you, because of the Almighty who blesses you from the heavens above, blessings from the deep springs below the ground, blessings from breasts and womb.
"The blessings of your father are greater than the blessings of the oldest mountains and the riches of the ancient hills. May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince among his brothers.
"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. In the morning and evening he destroys his enemies."
These are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is how Jacob blessed each of them.
Jacob told his sons: "Soon I will die. I want you to bury me in Machpelah Cave.
"Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there. Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there. I also buried Leah there.
"The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites."
Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons. He pulled his feet into his bed. He took his last breath and joined his ancestors in death.
Joseph threw himself on his father. He cried over him, and kissed him.
Then Joseph gave orders to embalm his father’s body.
It took forty days, which is the normal time for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the king’s officials: "Please take this message to the king:
"When my father was about to die, he made me promise him that I would bury him in the tomb that he had prepared in the land of Canaan. Please, let me go and bury my father. Then I will come back."
The king replied: "By all means go and bury your father, as you promised you would."
So Joseph went to bury his father. All the king’s officials, the senior men of his court, and all the leading men of Egypt went with Joseph.
His family, including his brothers, and the rest of his father’s family all went with him. Only their small children and their sheep, goats, and cattle stayed in the region of Goshen.
Men in chariots and men on horseback also went with him. It was a very large group.
They mourned loudly for a long time at the threshing place at Atad east of the Jordan. Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for seven days.
The citizens of Canaan saw those people mourning at Atad. They said: "What a solemn ceremony of mourning the Egyptians are holding!" That is why the place was named Abel-mizraim.
Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them.
They carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah east of Mamre. He was buried in the field Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground.
After the funeral, Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else returned to Egypt.
After Jacob died, Joseph’s brothers said to each other: "What if Joseph still hates us and wants to get even with us for all the cruel things we did to him?"
Thus they sent word to Joseph, saying: "Your father gave us orders before his death. He said,
"‘ You are to say to Joseph: "Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you. If it is your pleasure, forgive the sin of the servants of your father’s God." ’" Upon hearing these words Joseph was overcome with weeping.
Then his brothers also came and immediately bowed down in front of him. "We are your slaves!" they said.
Joseph replied to them: "Do not be afraid! I cannot take God’s place.
"Even though you planned evil against me, God planned good to come out of it. This was to keep many people alive, as he is doing now.
"You have nothing to fear. I will take care of you and your children." So he reassured them with kind words that touched their hearts.
Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his father’s family. He was a hundred and ten years old when he died.
Joseph lived long enough to see Ephraim’s children and grandchildren. He also lived to see the children of Manasseh’s son Machir. He welcomed them into his family.
Before Joseph died, he told his brothers: "I will not live much longer. God will take care of you. He will lead you out of Egypt to the land he promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
"Promise me that you will take my body with you when God leads you to that land."
Joseph died in Egypt at the age of one hundred and ten. His body was embalmed and put in a coffin.
These are the names of the sons of Israel who came with their families and with Jacob to Egypt:
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
Dan and Naphtali and Gad and Asher.
Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of Jacob’s descendants was seventy.
Joseph, all his brothers, and that entire generation died.
The children of Israel had many children. They became so numerous and strong that the land was filled with them.
A new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, began to rule in Egypt.
He said to his people: "There are too many Israelites! They are stronger than we are.
"We must outsmart them or they will increase in number. If war breaks out they will leave the country and join our enemies to fight against us."
So the Egyptians put slave masters over them in order to oppress them through forced labor. They built Pithom and Rameses as supply storage cities for Pharaoh.
However the more the Israelites were oppressed, the more they increased in number and spread out. The Egyptians could not stand them any longer.
They forced the Israelites to work hard as slaves.
The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives. Shiphrah and Puah were among them.
He said: "When you help the Hebrew women give birth on the birth stool, if it is a son you shall put him to death. If it is a daughter, then she shall live."
The midwives respected God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them. They let the boys live.
So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said: "Why have you let the boys live?"
The midwives replied to Pharaoh: "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women. They are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them."
God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: Every son who is born must be thrown into the Nile River. However, keep every daughter alive.
A man from Levi’s family married a Levite woman.
The woman became pregnant and bore a son. She saw how beautiful he was and hid him for three months.
When she could not hide him any longer, she took a basket made of papyrus reeds and coated it with tar and pitch. She put the baby in it and set it among the papyrus reeds near the bank of the Nile River.
The baby’s sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
The king’s daughter came to the river to bathe. Her servants walked along the bank. Suddenly she noticed the basket in the papyrus reeds and sent a slave woman to get it.
She opened it and saw a baby boy. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.
His sister asked her: "Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you?"
"Please do," she answered. So the girl went and brought the baby’s own mother.
Pharaoh’s daughter told her: "Take care of this child, and I will pay you. The baby’s mother carried him home and took care of him."
When he was old enough, she took him to the king’s daughter, who adopted him. She named him Moses because she said: "I pulled him out of the water."
After Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people his brothers were hard at work. He saw an Egyptian beating one of them.
Moses looked around to see if anyone was watching. Then he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.
The next day when Moses went out, he saw two Hebrews fighting. So he went to the man who started the fight and asked: "Why are you beating up one of your own people?"
The man replied: "Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Moses was afraid and said: "Surely the matter has become known."
When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian by a well.
Then the shepherds came and drove them away. Moses stood up and helped them water their flock.
When they returned to Reuel their father, he said, "Why have you come back so soon today?"
They said: "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds. He drew water for us and watered the flock."
He asked his daughters: "Where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
Moses was content to live with the man. He gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.
She bore a son, and he called his name Gershom. For he said: "I have been a stranger in a strange land."
Time went by and the king of Egypt died. The Israelites still groaned because they were slaves. So they cried out, and their cries for help went up to God.
God heard their groaning. He remembered his promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
God saw the Israelites being oppressed and was concerned about them.
One day Moses was taking care of the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock across the desert to Sinai, the holy mountain.
There the angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire coming from the middle of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but that it was not burning up.
"This is strange," he thought. "Why is the bush not burning up? I will go closer and see."
Jehovah saw that Moses came closer. He called to him from the middle of the bush: "Moses! Moses!" Moses answered: "Yes, here I am."
God said: "Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground.
"I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Moses covered his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
Jehovah said: "I have seen how my people are suffering as slaves in Egypt. I have heard them beg for my help because of the way they are being mistreated. I feel sorry for them.
"I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians. I will bring my people out of Egypt into a country where there is good land, rich with milk and honey. I will give them the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live.
"My people have begged for my help. I have seen how cruel the Egyptians are to them.
"Now go to Pharaoh! I am sending you to lead my people out of his country."
But Moses said: "Who am I to go to Pharaoh and lead your people out of Egypt?"
God said: "I will be with you! This shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain."
Then Moses said to God: "Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel. I will say to them: ‘ The God of your fathers has sent me to you. ’ ’ Now they may ask me: ‘ What is His name? ’ ’ What shall I say to them? ’"
God then said to Moses: "I exist and I WILL BE WHO I WILL BE." You shall say to the sons of Israel: "I WILL BE, has sent me to you. ’" Hebrew: hayah, "I was, I am, I will be" gives evidence of God’s eternal existence
God, further said to Moses: "You shall say to the sons of Israel: ‘ JEHOVAH, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. ’ ’ JEHOVAH THIS IS MY NAME FOREVER! This is my memorial-name to all generations.
Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them: JEHOVAH, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me. He said: "I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt."
"So I said: ‘ I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey." ’
"They will listen to what you say. You with the elders of Israel will approach the king of Egypt. You will say to him: ‘ Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. ’
"I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion.
"So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do in it’s midst. After that he will let you go.
"I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. When you go you will not go empty handed.
"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing. You will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Egyptians."
Moses responded: "What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say? For they may say: ‘ Jehovah has not appeared to you. ’"
Jehovah asked him: "What is that in your hand?" He answered: "A shepherd’s staff."
Jehovah said: "Throw it on the ground." When Moses threw it on the ground, it became a snake, and he ran away from it.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Reach down and pick it up by the tail." So Moses reached down and caught it. Suddenly it became a walking stick again.
Jehovah said: "Do this to prove to the Israelites that Jehovah, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to you."
Jehovah spoke to Moses again: "Put your hand inside your robe." Moses obeyed. When he took his hand out, it was diseased, covered with white spots, like snow.
Jehovah said: "Put your hand inside your robe again." He did so, and when he took it out this time, it was healthy, just like the rest of his body.
Jehovah said: "If they will not believe you or be convinced by the first sign, then this one will convince them.
"If in spite of these two signs they still will not believe you, and if they refuse to listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the ground. The water will turn into blood."
Moses said: "O Jehovah I am not a man of words. I have never been so, and am not now, even after what you have said to your servant. Talking is hard for me, and I am slow of tongue."
Jehovah said to him: "Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
"Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth. I will teach you what you are to say."
But Moses said: "Please, Jehovah, send the message by whomever you will."
Then the anger of Jehovah burned against Moses, and He said: "Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. He is coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
"You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth and his mouth. I will teach you what you are to do.
Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people. He will be as a mouth for you and you will be as God to him.
"Take your staff in your hand with which you shall perform the signs."
Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him: "Please, let me go, that I may return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive." Jethro said to Moses: "Go in peace."
Jehovah said to Moses in Midian: "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."
So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.
Jehovah said to Moses: "When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power. I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go."
"Say to Pharaoh: ‘ Thus says Jehovah, Israel is my son, my firstborn.
"‘ So I said to you: ‘ Let My son go that he may serve me. But you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn." ’"
Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that Jehovah met him and sought to put him to death.
Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and threw it at Moses’ feet. She said: "You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me."
Jehovah said to Aaron: "Go to meet Moses in the wilderness." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
Moses told Aaron all the words Jehovah sent him to tell Moses, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.
Then Moses and Aaron went to Egypt and assembled all the elders of the people of Israel.
Aaron told them everything Jehovah had said to Moses. He also did the miraculous signs for the people.
The people believed them. When they heard that Jehovah was concerned about the people of Israel and that he had seen their misery, they knelt, bowed low and worshiped.
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said: "Jehovah, the God of Israel, says: ‘ Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness. ’"
But Pharaoh responded: "Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, and besides, I will not let Israel go."
Then they said: "The God of the Hebrews met with us. Please, let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness. Then we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. Otherwise he will fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
The king of Egypt replied: "Moses and Aaron, why do you distract the people from their work? Get back to work!"
Pharaoh added: "Look how many people there are in the land! Do you want them to quit working?"
Pharaoh gave these orders to the slave drivers and foremen:
"Do not give the people any more straw to make bricks as you have been doing. Let them gather their own straw.
"Insist that they make the same number of bricks they were making before. Making fewer bricks will not be acceptable. They are lazy! That is why they are crying: Let us go offer sacrifices to our God.
"Make the work harder for these people so that they will be too busy to listen to lies."
The slave drivers and the Israelite foremen went out and said to the Israelites: "The king has said that he will not supply you with any more straw.
"He says that you must go and get it for yourselves wherever you can find it. You must still make the same number of bricks."
So the people went all over Egypt looking for straw.
The slave bosses were hard on them. They kept saying: "Each day you have to make as many bricks as you did when you were given straw."
The bosses beat the men in charge of the slaves and said: "Why did you not force the slaves to make as many bricks yesterday and today as they did before?"
Finally, the men in charge of the slaves went to the king and asked: "Why are you treating us like this?
"No one brings us any straw. Yet we are still ordered to make the same number of bricks. We are beaten with whips, and your own people are to blame."
The king replied: "You are lazy. You are just lazy! That is why you keep asking me to let you go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
"Get back to work! You will not be given straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks."
The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told: "Do not make fewer bricks each day than you are supposed to."
Leaving the Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting for them.
They said: "May Jehovah see what you have done and judge you! You have made Pharaoh and his officials hate us. You have given them an excuse to kill us."
Moses went back to Jehovah and asked: "Why have you brought this trouble on your people? Why did you send me?
"Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak for you, he has treated your people cruelly, and you have done nothing at all to rescue your people."
Jehovah said to Moses: "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. I will show him my power. He will let my people go! I will show him my power, and he will throw them out of his country."
God spoke further to Moses and said to him: "I am Jehovah.
"I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name, Jehovah, I did not make myself known to them.
"I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as foreigners.
"Furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel. This is because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage. I have remembered my covenant.
"Tell the sons of Israel: ‘ I am Jehovah. I will bring you out from under the oppression of the Egyptians. I will free you from slavery! I will rescue you with my powerful arm and with mighty acts of judgment. ’
"I will make you my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am Jehovah your God. I brought you out from under the forced labor of the Egyptians.
"I will bring you to the land I solemnly swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your own possession. I am Jehovah! ’"
Moses reported this to the Israelites. But they would not listen to him. For they were so discouraged by their backbreaking work.
Then Jehovah told Moses:
"Demand that Pharaoh king of Egypt let the sons of Israel go."
But Moses replied: "I am not a powerful speaker. If the sons of Israel will not listen to me, why should the king of Egypt?"
Jehovah sent Aaron and Moses with a message for the sons of Israel and for the king. He also ordered Aaron and Moses to free the people from Egypt.
The following men were the heads of their father’s households: The sons of Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari. Levi lived one hundred and thirty-seven years.
The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.
The sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived one hundred and thirty-three years.
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years.
The sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.
The sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.
Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
The sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites according to their families.
It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said: "Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts."
They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.
On the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
Jehovah said to Moses: "I am Jehovah! Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."
But Moses protested to Jehovah: "I am unskilled in speech. How then will Pharaoh listen to me?"
Jehovah said to Moses: "See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
"You shall speak all that I command you. Your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
"I will harden Pharaoh’s heart that I may multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
"The Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah when I use my power against Egypt and bring the sons of Israel out of there."
Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded them.
Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three when they talked to Pharaoh.
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
"Pharaoh will say: ‘ Give me a sign to prove that God has sent you. ’ ’ Tell Aaron: ‘ Take your shepherd’s staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh. It will become a large snake. ’
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They did as Jehovah commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials. It became a large snake.
Then Pharaoh sent for his wise men and sorcerers. These Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic spells.
Each of them threw his staff down. They all became large snakes. But Aaron’s staff swallowed theirs.
Pharaoh continued to be stubborn. Just as Jehovah had predicted, he would not listen to them.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Pharaoh is being stubborn. He will not let my people go.
"In the morning meet Pharaoh when he is on his way to the Nile. Wait for him on the bank of the river. Take the staff that turned into a snake.
"Say to Pharaoh: ‘ Jehovah the God of the Hebrews sent me to tell you, Let my people go to worship me in the wilderness. So far you have not listened. ’"
"Jehovah says: ‘ This is the way you will recognize that I am Jehovah: I will strike the Nile with this staff in my hand. The water will turn into blood.
‘ The fish in the Nile will die. The river will stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink any water from the Nile." ’"
Jehovah then spoke to Moses: "Tell Aaron, Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt; its rivers, canals, ponds, and all its reservoirs. They will turn into blood. There will be blood everywhere in Egypt, even in the buckets of wood and stone pitchers."
Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded. Aaron raised his staff and struck the Nile in front of Pharaoh and his officials. All the water in the river turned into blood.
The fish in the Nile died. The river smelled bad. The Egyptians could not drink any water from the river. There was blood everywhere in Egypt.
But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic spells. So Pharaoh continued to be stubborn. He would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as Jehovah predicted.
Pharaoh turned and went back to his palace. This did not change his mind and heart.
All the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink any of the water from the river.
Seven days passed after Jehovah struck the Nile.
Then Jehovah said to Moses: "Approach Pharaoh and say to him, ‘ Jehovah says: "Let My people go, that they may serve me.
"‘ "But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will afflict your whole territory with frogs.
"‘ "The Nile will swarm with frogs. They will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed. They will go into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls.
"‘ "The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants." ’"
Jehovah also said to Moses: "Say to Aaron, ‘ Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools. Make frogs come up on the land of Egypt. ’"
"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt. The frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
"But the magicians used their secret powers to do the same thing.
"The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them: If you ask Jehovah to take these frogs away from me and my people, I will let your people go and offer sacrifices to him."
Moses answered: "You choose the time when I am to pray for the frogs to stop bothering you, your officials, and your people, and for them to leave your houses and be found only in the river."
The king replied: "Do it tomorrow!" "As you wish:" Moses agreed. "Then everyone will discover that there is no god like Jehovah!
"The frogs will no longer be found anywhere, except in the Nile."
Moses and Aaron left the palace. Moses begged Jehovah to do something about the frogs he had sent as punishment for the king.
Jehovah did as Moses asked. The frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died.
The Egyptians piled them up in large mounds, until the land began to stink with them.
The king saw that the frogs were dead. He became stubborn again and, just as Jehovah had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Tell Aaron, "Strike the ground with your stick. The dust will change into gnats in all of Egypt. ’"
So Aaron struck the ground with his stick. The dust in Egypt was turned into gnats. They swarmed over the people and the animals.
The magicians tried to use their magic to make gnats appear, but they failed. There were gnats everywhere!
The magicians said to the king: "It is the finger of God!" God has done this! But the king was stubborn. Just as Jehovah predicted, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Early tomorrow morning, go and meet the king as he goes to the river. Tell him that Jehovah says: ‘ Let my people go, so that they can serve me.
"‘ "I warn you that if you refuse, I will punish you by sending flies on you, your officials, and your people. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies. The ground will be covered with them.
"‘ "At that same time I will cut off the land of Goshen where my people live. No swarms of flies shall be there. Then you will know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
"‘ "I will put a dividing line between my people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow." ’"
Jehovah did what he said. Dense swarms of flies came into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials. All over Egypt the flies ruined everything.
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron. He said: "Go, sacrifice to your God here in this country."
Moses replied: "It is not right to do that. The sacrifices we offer to Jehovah our God are disgusting to Egyptians. If they see us offer sacrifices that they consider disgusting, will they not stone us to death?
"We need to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to Jehovah our God, as he told us to do."
Pharaoh said: "I will let you go, but do not go far. You may offer sacrifices to Jehovah your God in the desert and pray for me."
Moses answered: "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to Jehovah. Tomorrow the swarms of flies will go away from you, your officials, and your people. But you must stop tricking us by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to Jehovah."
Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Jehovah.
Jehovah did what Moses asked. The swarms of flies left Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not a single fly was left.
Again Pharaoh was stubborn and did not let the people go.
Then Jehovah said to Moses: "Go to Pharaoh, and tell him, this is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews says: Let my people go to serve me.
"If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them in slavery,
Jehovah will bring a terrible plague on your livestock, including your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats.
"‘ "Jehovah will distinguish between Israel’s livestock and the livestock of the Egyptians. The animals belonging to the Israelites will not die." ’"
Jehovah set a definite time: "I, Jehovah, choose tomorrow as the time when I will do this."
The next day Jehovah did as he had said. The Egyptian’s animals all died. Not one of the animals of the Israelites died.
The king asked what had happened. He was told that none of the animals of the Israelites had died. He was stubborn and would not let the people go.
Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: "Take a few handfuls of ashes from a furnace. Moses is to throw them into the air in front of the king.
"They will spread out like fine dust over all the land of Egypt. They will produce boils that become open sores on the people and the animals."
They got some ashes and stood before the king. Moses threw them into the air. They produced boils that became open sores on the people and the animals.
The magicians were not able to appear before Moses, because they were covered with boils, like all the other Egyptians.
Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron. Everything happened just as Jehovah had told Moses.
Jehovah told Moses to get up early the next morning and say to the king: "God of the Hebrews commands you to let his people go, so they can serve him!
"If you do not, he will send his worst plagues to strike you, your officials, and everyone else in your country. Then you will find out that no one can oppose Jehovah.
"He could already have sent a terrible disease and wiped you from the face of the earth.
"I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you my power and in order to proclaim my name through all the earth.
"Still you exalt yourself against my people by not letting them go.
"At this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
"Bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home will die from the hail."
The ones among the servants of Pharaoh who respected the word of Jehovah made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses.
He who paid no regard to the word of Jehovah left his servants and his livestock in the field.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Stretch out your hand toward the sky. Hail will fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky. Then Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. Jehovah rained hail on the land of Egypt.
All over Egypt the hail knocked down everything that was out in the open. It struck down people, animals, and every plant in the fields and destroyed every tree in the fields.
The region of Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was the only place where there was no hail.
The king sent for Moses and Aaron and said: "This time I have sinned. Jehovah is in the right. My people and I are in the wrong.
"Pray to Jehovah! We have had enough of this thunder and hail! I promise to let you go. You do not have to stay here any longer."
Moses said to him: "As soon as I go out of the city, I will lift up my hands in prayer to Jehovah. The thunder will stop. There will be no more hail. Thus you may know that the earth belongs to Jehovah.
"But I know that you and your servants do not yet respect Jehovah God."
The flax and the barley were ruined, because the barley was ripe, and the flax was budding.
But the wheat crops ripen later, and they were not damaged.
Moses left the royal palace and the city. He lifted his arms in prayer to Jehovah. The thunder, hail, and drenching rain stopped.
The king realized that the storm was over. He disobeyed once more. He and his officials were so stubborn
that he refused to let the Israelites go. This was exactly what Jehovah said would happen.
Jehovah told Moses: "Go back to the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, so that I could work these signs.
"I did this because I want you to tell your children and your grandchildren about the mighty things and the signs I have done in Egypt. Then all of you will know that I am Jehovah."
Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him: "Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, ‘ How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
"‘ If you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
"‘ They shall cover the surface of the land. No one will be able to see the land. They will also eat the rest of what has escaped and is left to you from the hail. They will eat every tree that sprouts for you out of the field.
"‘ Your houses shall be filled and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians. This is something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day. He turned and went out from Pharaoh. ’"
Pharaoh’s servants said to him: "How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go so that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"
Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. He said to them: "Go! Serve Jehovah your God. Who are the ones that shall go?"
Moses said: "We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters. We will go with our flocks and with our herds. We must hold a feast to Jehovah."
He said to them: "May Jehovah be with you, as I send you and your little ones away. Watch out for evil is before you.
"Not so! You men go now and serve Jehovah. It is you who desired it." So they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts. Let them come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, all that the hail has left."
Moses held his staff over the land of Egypt. Jehovah made a wind from the east blow over the land all that day and all that night. By morning the east wind had brought the locusts.
They invaded all of Egypt and landed all over the country in great swarms. Never before had there been so many locusts, nor would there ever be that many again.
They covered all the ground until it was black with them. They ate all the plants and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt.
Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron and said: "I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.
"Please forgive my sin one more time. Pray to Jehovah your God to take this deadly plague away from me."
Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Jehovah.
Jehovah changed the wind to a very strong west wind. It picked up the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
But Jehovah made the king stubborn. He did not let the Israelites go.
Jehovah then said to Moses: "Raise your hand toward the sky. Darkness thick enough to be felt will cover the land of Egypt."
Moses raised his hand toward the sky. Total darkness fell throughout Egypt for three days.
The Egyptians could not see each other. No one left his house during that time. The Israelites, however, had light where they were living.
The king called Moses. He said: "You may go and worship Jehovah. Even your women and children may go with you. But your sheep, goats, and cattle must stay here."
Moses answered: "Then you would have to provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer to Jehovah our God.
"No, we will take our animals with us! Not one will be left behind. We must select the animals with which to worship Jehovah our God. We will not know what animals to sacrifice to him until we get there."
Jehovah made the king stubborn. He would not let them go.
He said to Moses: "Get out of my sight! Do not let me ever see you again! On the day I do, you will die!"
"You have spoken it!" Moses answered. "You will never see me again."
Jehovah said to Moses: "I will send only one more punishment plague on the king of Egypt and his people. After that he will let you leave. In fact, he will drive all of you out of here.
"Speak to the people of Israel and tell all of them to ask their neighbors for gold and silver jewelry."
Jehovah made the Egyptians respect the Israelites. Indeed, the officials and all the people considered Moses to be a very great man.
Moses approached the king. He said: "I have come to let you know what Jehovah is going to do. About midnight he will go through the land of Egypt,
and wherever he goes, the first-born son in every family will die. Your own son will die. So will the son of the lowest slave woman. Even the first-born males of cattle will die.
"Everywhere in Egypt there will be loud crying. Nothing like this has ever happened before or will ever happen again.
"But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even bark, whether against man or beast. This is so you may understand how Jehovah makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel."
All these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me. They will say: "Go out, you and all the people who follow you. Then I will go out." He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
Then Jehovah said to Moses: "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my signs will be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh. Yet Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart. He did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:
"This month shall be the beginning of months for you. It is to be the first month of the year to you.
"Tell the whole community of Israel: ‘ On the tenth day of this month each man must take a sheep for his family, one animal per household.
"‘ A household may be too small to eat a whole animal. That household and the one next-door can share one animal. Choose your animal based on the number of people and what each person can eat.
"‘ Your animal must be a one-year-old male that has no defects. You may choose a lamb or a young goat.
"‘ Take care of it until the fourteenth day of this month. Then at dusk, all the assembled people from the community of Israel must slaughter their animals.
"‘ Some of the blood must be put on the two doorposts and above the door of each house where the animals are to be eaten.
"‘ That night the animals are to be roasted and eaten, together with bitter herbs greens and unleavened bread made without yeast.
"‘ Do not eat the meat raw or boiled. The entire animal, including its head, legs, and insides, must be roasted.
"‘ Eat what you want that night, and the next morning burn whatever is left.
"‘ Eat it in this manner: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste. It is Jehovah’s Passover. ’"
Jehovah said: "That night I will go through the land of Egypt. I will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt! I am Jehovah!
"The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you live. When I see the blood I will pass over you. No plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
"This day will be a memorial to you. You shall celebrate it as a feast to Jehovah. You are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance throughout your generations.
"You will eat unleavened bread for seven days. The first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day will be cut off from Israel.
"You shall have a holy assembly on the first day. There should be another holy assembly on the seventh day. No work at all will be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person that alone may be prepared by you.
"You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. That was the day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Observe this day throughout your generations as a long lasting ordinance.
"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
"There shall be no leaven found in your houses for seven days. Whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an alien or a native of the land.
Moses called all the elders of Israel and said: "Take lambs according to your families and slay the Passover lamb.
"Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin. Apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. No one shall go outside the door of his house until morning.
"Jehovah will pass through to strike the Egyptians. When he sees the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe, Jehovah will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to kill you.
"You shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children from generation to generation.
"When you enter the land Jehovah will give you, as he has promised, you shall observe this rite.
"When your children ask you: What does this rite mean to you?
"You shall say: ‘ It is a Passover sacrifice to Jehovah who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He killed the Egyptians, but spared our homes. The people bowed low and worshiped. ’"
Then the sons of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron.
At midnight Jehovah killed every firstborn male in Egypt from the firstborn son of Pharaoh who ruled the land to the firstborn son of the prisoner in jail, and also every firstborn animal.
Pharaoh, all his officials, and all the other Egyptians got up during the night. There was loud crying throughout Egypt because in every house someone had died.
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron during the night. He said: "You and the Israelites must leave my people at once. Go serve Jehovah just as you requested.
"Take your flocks and herds, too, as you asked. Just go! And bless me, too!"
The Egyptians begged the people to leave the country quickly. They said: "We will all be dead soon!"
The people picked up their bread dough before it had risen. They carried it on their shoulders in bowls and wrapped up in their clothes.
The sons of Israel did what Moses told them. They asked the Egyptians for gold and silver jewelry and for clothes.
Jehovah made the Egyptians generous to the people. They gave them what they asked for. So the sons of Israel stripped Egypt of its wealth.
The Israelites left Rameses to go to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, plus all the women and children.
Many other people also went with them, along with large numbers of sheep, goats, and cattle.
With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked round, flat bread. The dough had not risen because they had been thrown out of Egypt and had no time to prepare food for the trip.
The Israelites had been living in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years.
After exactly four hundred and thirty years all of Jehovah’s people left Egypt in organized family groups.
It is a night to be observed for Jehovah for having brought them out from the land of Egypt. This night is for Jehovah and should be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: "This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat of it.
"After you have circumcised your purchased slave he may eat of it.
"No foreigner visiting you may eat it. No hired worker may eat it.
"The meal must be eaten inside one house. Never take any of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
"The entire community of Israel must celebrate the Passover.
"The uncircumcised man may not eat it. If a foreigner has settled among you and wants to celebrate Passover to honor Jehovah, you must first circumcise all the males of his household. He is then to be treated like a native-born Israelite and may join in the festival.
"The same regulations apply to native-born Israelites and to foreigners who settle among you."
All the Israelites obeyed. They did what Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron.
On that day Jehovah brought the Israelite tribes out of Egypt.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Consecrate appoint sanctify all the first-born males to me. Every first-born male Israelite and every first-born male animal belongs to me!"
Moses said to the people: "Remember this day in the month of Abib. It is the day Jehovah’s mighty power rescued you from slavery in Egypt. Do not eat anything made with yeast.
"You are going out this day in the month Abib.
"Jehovah shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. He swore to your fathers to give you this land flowing with milk and honey. You shall observe this rite in this month.
"You must eat unleavened bread seven days. The seventh day will be a feast to Jehovah.
"Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. No leavened bread shall be seen with you or in all your borders.
"On that day tell your children: ‘ We do this because of what Jehovah did for us when we left Egypt. ’"
"This festival will be like a mark on your hand. It will be a reminder on your forehead that the teachings of Jehovah are always to be a part of your conversation! Jehovah used his mighty hand to bring you out of Egypt.
"You must follow these rules every year at this time.
"When Jehovah brings you to the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he swore to you and your ancestors,
sacrifice every firstborn male offspring to Jehovah. The firstborn male offspring of each of your animals belongs to Jehovah.
"It will cost you a sheep or a goat to buy any firstborn donkey back from Jehovah. You must break the donkey’s neck if you do not buy it back. You must also buy every firstborn son back from Jehovah.
"In the future when your children ask you, ‘ What does this mean? ’ ’ tell them: ‘ Jehovah used his mighty hand to bring us out of slavery in Egypt. ’ ’"
"Pharaoh was too stubborn to let us go. Because of this every firstborn male in Egypt-human and animal was killed. This is why we sacrifice every firstborn male to Jehovah and buy every firstborn son back from Jehovah.
"This festival will be like a mark on your hand and like a band on your forehead, because Jehovah used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt."
"When the king of Egypt let the people go God did not take them on the road that goes up the coast to Philistia, although it was the shortest way. God thought: I do not want the people to change their minds and return to Egypt when they see that they are going to have to fight."
He led them by way of the desert by the Red Sea. The Israelites were armed for battle.
Moses took the body of Joseph with him. Joseph made the Israelites solemnly promise to do so. Joseph said: When God rescues you, you must carry my body with you from this place.
The Israelites left Sukkoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
Jehovah went in front of them in a pillar of cloud to show them the way during the day. He went in front of them in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel at night.
The pillar of cloud was always in front of the people during the day, and the pillar of fire at night.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the Red Sea, near Baal Zephon.
"The king will think that the Israelites are wandering around in the country and are closed in by the desert.
"I will make him stubborn. He will pursue you. My victory over the king and his army will bring me honor. Then the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah!" The Israelites did as they were told.
The king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped. He and his officials changed their minds and said: "What have we done? We have let the Israelites escape, and we have lost them as our slaves!"
The king got his war chariot and army ready.
He commanded his officers in charge of his six hundred best chariots and all his other chariots to start after the Israelites.
Jehovah made the king so stubborn that he went after them. The Israelites proudly went on their way.
The king’s horses and chariots and soldiers caught up with them while they were camping by the Red Sea near Pi-Hahiroth and Baal-Zephon.
The Israelites saw the king coming with his army. They were frightened and begged Jehovah for help.
They also complained to Moses: Was there not enough room in Egypt to bury us? Is that why you brought us out here to die in the desert? Why did you bring us out of Egypt?
"Did we not say in Egypt: Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert."
But Moses said to the people: "Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of Jehovah. He will accomplish this for you today. The Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
"Jehovah will fight for you while you keep silent."
Jehovah said to Moses: "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward.
"As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. The sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land.
"I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
"Then the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen."
The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. Jehovah swept the sea back by a strong east wind all night and turned the sea into dry land. The waters were divided.
The Israelites went through the middle of the sea on dry ground. The water stood like a wall on their right and on their left.
The Egyptians pursued them. Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry followed them into the sea.
Just before dawn, Jehovah looked down from the column of fire and smoke and threw the Egyptian camp into a panic.
He made the wheels of their chariots come off. They could hardly move. Then the Egyptians shouted: "Let us get out of here! Jehovah is fighting for Israel! He is against us!"
Jehovah then said to Moses: "Hold out your hand over the sea, and the water will flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and drivers."
Moses held out his hand over the sea. At daybreak the water returned to its normal level. The Egyptians tried to escape from the water. But Jehovah threw them into the sea.
The water returned and covered the chariots, the drivers, and all the Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea. None of them were left.
On the other hand, the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides.
That day Jehovah saved the people of Israel from the Egyptians. The Israelites saw them lying dead on the seashore.
The Israelites saw the great power with which Jehovah had defeated the Egyptians. So they stood in awe of Jehovah. They had faith in Jehovah and in his servant Moses.
Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Jehovah: "I will sing to Jehovah, because he has won a glorious victory. He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.
"Jehovah is my strong defender. He is the one who has saved me. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will sing about his greatness.
"Jehovah is His name, and he is a warrior!
"He threw the chariots and army of Egypt’s king into the Red Sea, and he drowned the best of the king’s army.
"The depths have covered them. They sank to the bottom just like boulders.
"With the tremendous force of your right arm, Jehovah, you crushed your enemies.
"In the greatness of your excellence you overthrow those who rose up against you. You sent your wrath and consumed them like stubble.
"With a blast from your nostrils, the water piled up. The waves stood up like a dam. The deep water thickened in the middle of the sea.
"The enemy said: ‘ I will pursue them! I will catch them! I will divide the loot! I will take all I want! I will use my sword! I will take all they have! ’"
"Your breath blew the sea over them. They sank like lead in the raging water.
"Who among the gods is like you Jehovah? Who is like you, wonderful in holiness? Who can work wonders and mighty acts like yours?
"You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed our enemies.
"Using your powerful love, you rescued redeemed the people.
"Nations learned of this and trembled. The Philistines shook with horror.
"The sheiks chiefs of Edom were dismayed. The leaders of Moab are griped with fear. The inhabitants of Canaan are filled with fear.
"Terror and dread fall upon them. By the greatness of your arm they are motionless as stone. Until your people pass over, O Jehovah, until the people pass over whom you have purchased.
"You will bring them and plant them on your own mountain, the place where you live, O Jehovah, the holy place that you built with your own hands, O Jehovah.
"Jehovah will rule as king forever and ever."
When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry went into the sea, Jehovah made the water of the sea flow back over them. The Israelites had gone through the sea on dry ground.
The prophet Miriam, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand. All the women, danced with tambourines, and followed her.
Miriam sang to them: "Sing to Jehovah. He has won a glorious victory. He has thrown horses and their riders into the sea."
Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water because it tasted bitter. That is why the place was called Marah Bitter Place.
The people complained about Moses. They asked: "What can we drink?"
Moses cried out to Jehovah. Jehovah showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. Jehovah presented laws and rules for them to live by. He tested them there.
He said: "If you will listen carefully to Jehovah your God and do what he considers right, if you pay attention to his commands and obey all his laws, I will never make you suffer any of the diseases I made the Egyptians suffer. I am Jehovah, who heals you."
Then they went to Elim. There were twelve springs and seventy palm trees. They camped there by the water.
The whole congregation of Israelites moved from Elim to the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. This was on the fifteenth day of the second month after they left Egypt.
The entire congregation complained about Moses and Aaron in the desert.
The Israelites said to them: "If only Jehovah had allowed us die in Egypt! There we sat by our pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted! You brought us out into this desert to let us all starve to death!"
Jehovah said to Moses: "I am going to cause food to rain down from the sky for all of you. The people must go out every day and gather enough for that day. In this way I can test them to find out if they will follow my instructions.
"They are to bring in twice as much as usual and prepare it on the sixth day."
Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: "This evening you will know that it was Jehovah who brought you out of Egypt.
"In the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah’s presence. He hears your complaints against him. But what are we that you complain against us?"
Moses said: "This will happen when Jehovah gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to eat in the morning. Jehovah hears your complaints against him. And what are we? Your complaints are not against us but against Jehovah."
Moses said to Aaron: "Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel: ‘ Come near before Jehovah for he has heard your complaints. ’"
Aaron was speaking to them, when everyone looked out toward the desert and saw the bright glory of Jehovah in a cloud.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"I have heard my people complain. I said to them: ‘ Each evening you will have meat and each morning they will have more than enough bread. ’ ’ Then you will know that I am Jehovah their God. ’"
That evening many quails came and landed everywhere in the camp, and the next morning dew covered the ground.
After the dew had gone, the desert was covered with thin flakes that looked like frost.
When the children of Israel saw, they said to one another: "What is this?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them: "This is the bread Jehovah has given you to eat."
This is what Jehovah has commanded: "Each man should gather according to what he can eat. You shall take two quarts for each person in your tent."
The sons of Israel did this. Some gathered much and some little.
They measured it. Those who gathered much did not have too much. Some who gathered less did not have too little. Each had gathered just what he needed.
Moses said: "No one is to keep any of it for tomorrow."
Some of them did not listen to Moses and saved part of it. The next morning it was full of worms and smelled rotten. Moses was angry with them.
Every morning each one gathered as much as he needed. When the sun grew hot, what was left on the ground melted.
The sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts for each person. All the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses about it.
Moses said: "Jehovah has commanded that tomorrow is a holy day of rest, dedicated to God. Bake today what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Whatever is left should be put aside and kept for tomorrow."
They kept what was left until the next day as Moses commanded. It did not spoil or get worms in it.
Moses said: "Eat this today, because today is the Sabbath, a day of rest dedicated to Jehovah. You will not find any food outside the camp.
"You shall gather it for six days. But on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there shall be none."
Some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather. They did not find any.
Jehovah spoke to Moses: "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my instructions?
"Jehovah has given you the Sabbath. He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place! Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
So the people rested on the seventh day.
The house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white in color. It tasted like wafers made with honey.
Moses said: "This is what Jehovah has commanded: ‘ Let two quarts of it be kept throughout your generations. Then they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt. ’"
Moses said to Aaron: "Take a jar, and put two quarts of manna in it. Place it before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations."
Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be kept just as Jehovah commanded Moses.
The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
The standard dry measure used in Moses’ day equaled twenty quarts.
The entire congregation of Israelites left the desert of Sin and traveled from place to place as Jehovah commanded them. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
So they complained to Moses about this: "Give us water to drink!" Moses said: "Why do you complain to me? Why do you test Jehovah?"
The people were thirsty for water. They complained to Moses and asked: "Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Was it to make us, our children, and our livestock die of thirst?"
Moses cried out to Jehovah: "What should I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me!"
Jehovah said to Moses: "Go in front of the people. Take the elders of Israel with you. Take your rod with which you struck the river, in your hand, and go.
"Behold! I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb. Strike the rock and water will come out of it. Then the people may drink." Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the complaining of the children of Israel, and because they tested Jehovah, saying: "Is Jehovah among us or not?"
The Amalekites fought Israel at Rephidim.
Moses said to Joshua: "Choose some of our men. Then fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill. I will hold in my hand the staff God told me to take along."
Joshua did as Moses told him. They fought the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill.
As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel would win, but as soon as he put his hands down, the Amalekites would start to win.
Finally, Moses was so tired that Aaron and Hur got a rock for him to sit on. They stood beside him and supported his arms in the same position until sunset.
That is how Joshua defeated the Amalekites.
After the fight Jehovah said to Moses: "Write an account of this victory and read it to Joshua. I want the Amalekites to be forgotten forever."
Moses built an altar. He named it: "Jehovah Gives Me Victory."
Then Moses explained: "This is because I depended on Jehovah. But in future generations, Jehovah will have to fight the Amalekites again."
Jethro was the priest of Midian and the father-in-law of Moses. He heard what Jehovah God had done for Moses and his people, after rescuing them from Egypt.
Moses sent his wife Zipporah and her two sons to stay with Jethro. Jethro welcomed them.
Moses was still a foreigner in Midian when his first son was born. Moses said: "I will name him Gershom."
When his second son was born, Moses said: "I will name him Eliezer, because the God my father worshiped has saved me from the king of Egypt."
Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law brought Moses’ sons and wife to Moses in the desert. He was camped near the mountain of God.
Jethro sent word to Moses: "I am coming to visit you. I am bringing your wife and her two sons."
Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. Moses bowed with his face touching the ground and kissed Jethro. They asked each other how they were. Then they entered the tent.
Moses told his father-in-law everything Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel. He talked about all the hardships they had on the way, and how Jehovah saved them.
Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness Jehovah had done to Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians.
Jethro said: "Blessed be Jehovah who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh. He delivered the people from under the domination of the Egyptians.
"Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods. It was proven when they treated the people with contempt."
Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
The next day Moses settled disputes among the people. He was busy from morning till night.
Jethro saw everything that Moses had to do. He asked: "What is all this that you are doing for the people? Why are you doing this all alone? There are people standing here from morning till night to consult you?"
Moses answered: "They come here to find out what God wants them to do.
"They bring their complaints to me. I make decisions on the basis of God’s laws."
Jethro replied: "That is not a good way to do it.
"You and your people will wear yourselves out. This is too much work for you. You cannot do it alone!
"Listen to the advice I give you. May God be with you! You must be the people’s representative to God and bring their disagreements to him.
"You must instruct them in the laws and the teachings. Show them how to live and tell them what to do.
"You should choose capable men from all the people. Find men who respect God. These must be men you can trust who hate corruption. Put them in charge of groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
"They must be the ones who usually settle disagreements among the people. They should bring all-important cases to you. But they should settle all minor cases themselves. Make it easier for yourself by letting them help you.
"If you do this, as God commands, you will not wear yourself out. All these people can go home with their disputes settled."
Moses took Jethro’s advice
and chose capable men from among all the Israelites. He appointed them as leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
They judged the people on a permanent basis. The difficult cases were taken to Moses but they decided the smaller disputes themselves.
Moses said good-bye to Jethro, and Jethro went back home.
The Israelites arrived at the desert of Sinai in the third month after they left the land of Egypt.
Jehovah called Moses from the mountain. So Moses went up the mountain to God. Jehovah told him: "This is what you must say to the descendants of Jacob. Tell the Israelites:
‘ You have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on the wings of eagles and brought you to me.
‘ If you will obey me and are faithful to the terms of my covenant, then out of all the nations you will be my own special possession, for all the earth is mine.
‘ You will be my kingdom of priests and my holy nation. These are the words you must speak to the children of Israel. ’"
Moses went down the mountain and called for the elders of the people. He repeated to them all the words that Jehovah had commanded him.
All the people answered together: "We will do everything Jehovah has said." So Moses brought their answer back to Jehovah.
Jehovah said to Moses: "I will come to you in a thick cloud. The people will hear me speaking with you and will believe you from now on." Moses gave Jehovah the people’s answer.
Jehovah continued: "Go to the people and tell them to spend today and tomorrow purifying themselves for worship. They must wash their clothes.
"They should be ready in three days. I will descend to Mount Sinai, where all of them can see me.
"Warn the people that they are forbidden to touch any part of the mountain. Anyone who touches the mountain will be put to death,
with stones or arrows, and no one must touch the body of a person killed in this way. Even an animal that touches this mountain must be put to death. You may go up the mountain only after a signal is given on the trumpet."
Moses went down from the mountain to the people. He consecrated the people, and they washed their garments.
He said to the people: "Get ready for the third day. Do not go near a woman for sexual intercourse."
On the morning of the third day there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain. A very loud trumpet sounded. It caused all the people in the camp to tremble.
Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God. They stood at the foot of the mountain.
Mount Sinai was all in smoke because Jehovah descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace. The whole mountain quaked violently!
The sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.
Jehovah descended on the top of Mount Sinai. Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain. Moses climbed to the peak of Mount Sinai.
Jehovah spoke to Moses: "Go down and warn the people. They should not break through to gaze at Jehovah. Many of them would perish.
"Let the priests who come near to Jehovah consecrate purify themselves, or else Jehovah will destroy them."
Moses said to Jehovah: "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai for you warned us. You said: ‘ Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy. ’"
Jehovah replied to him: "You and Aaron come up to me. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, or he will destroy some of them."
Moses returned to the people and told them.
God spoke all these words:
"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of slavery in Egypt.
"Do not have any other god.
"Do not make your own carved idols or statues that represent any creature in the sky, on the earth, or in the water.
"Do not worship them or serve them. I, Jehovah your God, am a God demanding exclusive devotion. I do not tolerate rivals. I will not share your affection with any other god. I punish children for their parents’ sins to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.
"I show mercy loving kindness to thousands of generations of those who love me and obey my commandments.
"Never use the name of Jehovah your God in a false and evil way. Jehovah will make sure that anyone who is false, evil, careless and vain with his name will be punished.
"Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy.
"You have six days to do all your work.
"The seventh day is a Sabbath dedicated to Jehovah your God. Do not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.
"Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them in six days. He rested on the seventh day. Therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land Jehovah your God gives you.
"Do not murder.
"Do not commit adultery.
"Do not steal.
"Do not lie accuse anyone falsely.
"Do not covet desire another man’s house. Do not desire his wife, his slaves, his cattle, his donkeys, or anything else that he owns.
The people heard the thunder and the trumpet blast. They saw the lightning and the smoking mountain. They trembled with fear and stood at a distance.
They said to Moses: "If you speak to us, we will listen. However, we are afraid that if God speaks to us, we will die."
Moses responded: "Do not be afraid. God has only come to test you and to inspire you to obey him, so that you will not sin."
But the people continued to stand at a distance. Only Moses went near the dark cloud where God was.
Jehovah commanded Moses to tell the Israelites: "You have seen how I have spoken to you from heaven.
"Do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gold to be worshiped in addition to me.
"Make an altar of earth for me. Sacrifice your sheep and your cattle as offerings to be completely burned and as peace offerings. In every place that I set-aside for you to worship me, I will come to you and bless you.
"If you make an altar of stone for me, do not build it out of cut stones. This is because when you use a chisel on stones, you make them unfit for my use.
"Do not build an altar for me with steps leading up to it. If you do, you will expose yourselves as you go up the steps."
"These are the ordinances you should set before them.
"When you buy a Hebrew slave he will be your slave for six years. In the seventh year he may leave as a free man without paying for his freedom.
"If he was single at the time you bought him he alone must be set free. If he was married at that time, both he and his wife must be given their freedom.
"If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will belong to her master. He shall go out alone.
"What if the slave loves his wife and children so much that he will not leave without them?
"He must stand beside either the door or the doorpost at the place of worship. His owner will punch a small hole through one of his ears with a sharp metal rod. This makes him a slave for life.
"When a man sells his daughter into slavery, she will not go free the way male slaves do.
"If she does not please the master who has chosen her as a wife, he must let her be bought back by one of her close relatives. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, since he has treated her unfairly.
"If a man buys a female slave to give to his son, he should treat her like a daughter.
"If a man takes a second wife, he must continue to give his first wife the same amount of food and clothing and the same rights that she had before.
"If he fails to do any of these things, she should be given her freedom without cost.
"Death is the punishment for murder.
"If you did not intend to kill someone and I, Jehovah, let it happen anyway, you may run for safety to a place that I have set aside.
"If a man schemes and kills a man deliberately remove him from my altar and put him to death.
"He who strikes beats his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
"Whoever kidnaps another person must be put to death regardless of whether he has sold the kidnapped person or still has him.
"Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.
"When men quarrel and one hits the other with a rock or with his fist and injures him so that he has to stay in bed you must do this.
"If a slave owner takes a stick and beats his slave, whether male or female, and the slave dies on the spot, the owner is to be punished.
"If the slave lives a few days after the beating, you are not to be punished. After all, you have already lost the services of that slave who was your property.
"When a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting, if she is not badly hurt, the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve.
"The payment will be for life if she is seriously injured,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
"burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
"If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, and destroys it, he shall let him go free because of his eye.
"If he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free because of his tooth.
"If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished.
"If an ox was previously in the habit of goring and its owner has been warned, yet he does not confine it and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.
"If a ransom is demanded of him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded of him.
"Whether it gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same rule.
"If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner shall give his or her master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
"If a man opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it over, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
the owner of the pit shall make restitution. He will give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall become his.
"If one man’s ox hurts another’s so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally. They should divide the dead ox.
"If it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring, yet its owner has not confined it, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall become his."
"A man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it. He must pay five oxen for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.
"If the thief is caught while breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no blood guiltiness on his account.
"Someone lets his livestock graze in a field or a vineyard. They stray and graze in another person’s field. He must make up for what the damaged field was expected to produce. If he lets them ruin the whole field with their grazing, he must make up from his own field for the loss with the best from his field and vineyard.
"A fire starts and spreads into the underbrush so that it burns up stacked or standing grain or ruins a field. The person who started the fire must make up for the loss.
"Someone gives his neighbor silver or other valuables to keep for him. They are stolen from that person’s house. If the thief is caught, he must make up for the loss with double the amount.
"If the thief is not caught, the owner of the house must be brought to God to find out whether or not he took his neighbor’s valuables.
"There is a dispute over the ownership of a bull, a donkey, a sheep, an article of clothing, and any other lost property which two people claim as their own. Both people must bring their case to God. The one whom God declares guilty must make up for his neighbor’s loss with double the amount.
"Someone gives his neighbor a donkey, a bull, a sheep, or any other kind of animal to keep for him, and it dies, is injured, or is captured in war, and there are no witnesses.
"The case between them must be settled by swearing an oath to Jehovah that the neighbor did not take the other person’s animal. The owner must accept the oath. The neighbor does not have to make up for the loss.
"However, if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, he must make up for the owner’s loss.
"If a wild animal killed the neighbor’s animal he must bring in the dead body of the wild animal as evidence. He does not have to make up for an animal that has been killed.
"Whenever someone borrows an animal from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, the borrower must make up for the loss.
"If the owner is with the animal, the borrower does not have to make up for the loss. If it is rented, the rental fee covers the loss.
"When a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged to anyone and has sexual intercourse with her, he must pay the bride price and marry her.
"If her father refuses to give her to him, he must pay an amount of money equal to the bride price for virgins.
"Never allow a witch to live.
"The person who has sexual intercourse with an animal must be put to death.
"The person who sacrifices to any god except Jehovah must be condemned and destroyed.
"Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner. Remember that you were foreigners in Egypt.
"Do not mistreat any widow or orphan.
"If you do, I, Jehovah, will answer them when they cry out to me for help,
and I will become angry and kill you in war. Your wives will become widows, and your children will be fatherless.
"When you lend money to any of my people who are poor, do not act like a moneylender and require him to pay interest.
"If you take someone’s cloak as a pledge that he will pay you, you must give it back to him before the sunsets,
for it is the only covering he has to keep him warm. What else can he sleep in? When he cries out to me for help, I will answer him because I am merciful.
"Do not curse God. Do not curse a ruler of your people.
"Do not delay the offering from your harvest and your vintage. Give the firstborn of your sons to me.
"Do the same with your oxen and with your sheep. Its mother may keep it for seven days. On the eighth day give it to me.
"You are to be my holy people. Do not eat any flesh torn to bits in the field. Throw it to the dogs.
"Do not spread false rumors. Do not help a guilty person by offering false testimony.
"Do not follow the majority to do wrong. Do not give testimony that perverts justice.
"Do not show partiality to a poor man at his trial.
"If you see your enemy’s cow or donkey running loose, take it back to him.
"If your enemy’s donkey falls under its load, help him get the donkey to its feet again. Do not just walk away.
"Do not deny justice to a poor person at his trial.
"Do not make false accusations. Do not put an innocent person to death. I will condemn anyone who does this evil thing.
"Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe makes the discerning blind to what is right and perverts the words of the righteous.
"Do not mistreat a foreigner. You know how it feels to be a foreigner. After all you were foreigners in Egypt.
"Plant your land and gather in what it produces for six years.
"Let your land rest the seventh year. Do not harvest anything that grows on it. The poor may eat what grows there. The wild animals may have what is left. Do the same with your vineyards and your olive trees.
"Work six days a week. Do no work on the seventh day. Allow your slaves and the foreigners who work for you and even your animals to rest.
"Listen to everything Jehovah has said to you. Do not pray to other gods! Do not even mention their names.
"Celebrate three festivals a year to honor me.
"In the month of Abib, the month in which you left Egypt, celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the way that I commanded you. Do not eat any bread made with yeast during the seven days of this festival. Never come to worship me without bringing an offering.
"Celebrate the Harvest Festival when you begin to harvest your crops. Celebrate the Festival of Shelters in the autumn, when you gather the fruit from your vineyards and orchards.
"All your males should appear before Jehovah God three times a year.
"Do not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread. Do not allow the fat of my feast to remain overnight until morning.
"Bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of Jehovah your God. Do not boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.
"I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place that I have prepared.
"Be on your guard before him and obey his voice. Do not be rebellious toward him. He will not pardon your transgression, since my name is in him. He has my honor, authority and character
"If you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
"My messenger will go ahead of you. I will lead you to the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites. I will wipe them out.
"Do not worship or serve their gods or follow their practices. You must destroy their gods and crush their sacred stones.
"You must serve Jehovah your God! I will bless your food and water. I will take away all sickness from among you.
"No woman in your land will miscarry or be unable to have children. I will let you live a normal life span.
"I will send my terror ahead of you and throw any nation you meet into a panic. I will make all your enemies flee from you.
"I will throw your enemies into panic! I will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites as you advance.
"I will not drive them out within a year’s time. If I did, the land would become deserted. There would be too many wild animals for you.
"I will drive them a few at a time, until there are enough of you to take possession of the land.
"I will make the borders of your land extend from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterranean Sea and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give you power over the inhabitants of the land. You will drive them out as you advance.
"Do not make any agreement with them or with their gods.
"Do not allow them to live in your land for they will make you sin against me. If you serve their gods it will be a snare to you."
Jehovah said to Moses: "You and Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of Israel’s elders come up the mountain to me and worship at a distance.
"Moses alone may come near Jehovah. The others may not. The people must not come along with Moses."
Moses told the people all Jehovah’s words and legal decisions. Then all the people answered with one voice: "We will do everything Jehovah told us to do."
Moses wrote down all Jehovah’s words. Early the next morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain. He erected twelve sacred stones for the twelve tribes of Israel.
Moses sent young men to burn sacrifices to Jehovah. They sacrificed some cattle as peace offerings.
Moses took half of the blood of the animals and put it in bowls. The other half he threw against the altar.
He took the book of the covenant, in which Jehovah’s commandments were written, and read it aloud to the people. They said: "We will obey Jehovah. We will do everything that he has commanded."
Moses took the blood from the bowls and sprinkled it on the people. Next, he told them: With this blood Jehovah makes his agreement with you.
Moses and Aaron, together with Nadab and Abihu and the seventy leaders, went up the mountain.
They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something that looked like a pavement made out of sapphire. It was as bright as the sky.
Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, he did not punish them. So they ate and drank.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Come up on the mountain and stay here for a while. I will give you the two stone tablets on which I have written the laws that my people must obey."
Moses and Joshua his assistant got ready. Moses started up the mountain to meet with God.
He said to the elders: "Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are with you. Anyone with a legal matter should approach them."
Moses went up to the mountain. The cloud covered the mountain.
The glory of Jehovah rested on Mount Sinai. The cloud covered it for six days. God called to Moses on the seventh day. He spoke from inside the cloud.
Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain. He was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Then Jehovah spoke to Moses. He said:
"Tell the Israelites to choose something to give me as a special contribution. You must accept whatever contribution each person freely gives.
"This is the type of contribution you will accept from them: gold, silver, and bronze,
violet, purple, and bright red yarns, fine linen, goats’ hair,
rams’ skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,
olive oil for the lamps, spices balsam oil for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense,
onyx stones, and other precious stones to be set in the chief priest’s ephod and his breastplate.
"Have them make a holy place sanctuary for me, and I will live among them.
"Make the tent and all its furnishings exactly like the plans I show you.
"Make a Box out of acacia wood, forty-five inches long, twenty-seven inches wide, and twenty-seven inches high.
"Cover it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold border all around it.
"Make four carrying rings of gold for it and attach them to its four legs, with two rings on each side.
"Make two poles of acacia wood. Cover them with gold.
"Put them through the rings. Poles can be used to carry the chest.
"Do not ever remove the poles from the rings.
"I will give you the Ten Commandments written on two flat tablets. Put them inside the chest.
"Cover the lid of the chest mercy seat with pure gold.
"Hammer out two winged cherubs of pure gold and fasten them to the lid at the ends of the chest.
"Make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. You shall make the cherubim of one piece with the chest at its two ends.
"The cherubim shall have their wings spread upward, covering the chest with their wings and facing one another. The faces of the cherubim are to be turned toward the chest.
"After you put into the ark the words of my covenant that I will give you, place the throne of mercy on top.
"I will be above the throne of mercy between the angels whenever I meet with you. I will give you all my commandments for the Israelites.
"Make a table of acacia wood thirty-six inches long, eighteen inches wide, and twenty-seven inches high.
"Cover it with pure gold. Put a gold molding around it.
"Make a rim three inches wide around it. Put a gold molding around the rim.
"Make four gold rings for it. Fasten them to the four corners where the four legs are.
"The rings are to be close to the rim. They are to hold the poles for carrying the table.
"Make the poles out of acacia wood. Cover them with gold and use them to carry the table.
"The plates and dishes for the table should be out of pure gold. Also make pitchers and bowls to be used for pouring wine offerings.
"The table should be placed in front of the Covenant Box. There is always to be the sacred bread offered to me for the table.
"Make lamp stand of pure gold. Make its base and its shaft of hammered gold. Its decorative flowers, including buds and petals, are to form one piece with it.
"Six branches shall extend from its sides, three from each side.
"Three cups shall be shaped like almond blossoms in the one branch, a bulb and a flower, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms in the other branch. This should go on for six branches going out from the lamp stand.

"Regardless of how they are used all the things for the tent must be made of copper. Even the pegs for the tent and the courtyard must be made of copper.
"Command the Israelites that the lighting must be provided by pure virgin olive oil so that the lamps will not go out.
"Keep the lamps lit in the tent of meeting outside the canopy where the words of my covenant are. Aaron and his descendants must keep the lamps lit in Jehovah’s presence from evening until morning. This is a long lasting law among the Israelites for generations to come.
Jehovah continued: "Bring your brother Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar to you from all the Israelites. They will serve me as priests.
"Make sacred clothes for your brother Aaron to give him dignity and honor.
"Tell all the skilled men whom I have given this ability to make Aaron’s clothes. These clothes will set him apart as holy when he serves me as priest.
"The clothes they will make are as follows: a breastplate, an ephod and the robe that is worn with it, another specially woven linen robe, the chief priest’s turban, and a cloth belt. They will make these holy clothes for your brother Aaron and his sons so that they will be able to serve me as priests.
"Take the gold and blue thread and wool that is dyed bright read and the fine linen and
"prepare the ephod with fine linen yarn. Embroider gold, violet, purple, and bright red yarn into the fabric.
"It should have two shoulder straps attached at the top corners so it can be fastened.
"Make the belt that is attached to the ephod from the same fabric.
"Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on two onyx stones.
"Engrave them in order of their birth. Place six names on each stone.
"Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the same way a jeweler engraves a signet ring. Mount them in gold settings.
"Then fasten them on the shoulder straps of the ephod as reminders of who the Israelites are. In this way Aaron will carry their names on his shoulders as a reminder in Jehovah’s presence.
"Make gold settings.
"Also make two chains of pure gold. These gold chains should be twisted like ropes. Fasten these chains to the settings.
"Prepare the breast piece for decision-making using a skilled craftsman. Make it like the ephod out of gold, violet, purple, and bright red yarn and out of fine linen yarn.
"Fold it in half so it is nine inches square.
"Fasten four rows of precious stones on it. Put red quartz, topaz, and emerald in the first row.
"Place turquoise, sapphire, and crystal in the second row.
"In the third row put jacinth, agate, and amethyst.
"In the fourth row put beryl, onyx, and gray quartz. Mount them in gold settings.
"The stones represent the twelve sons of Israel, by name, each stone engraved like a signet ring with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
"Make chains out of pure gold, twisted like ropes for the breastplate.
"Make two gold rings for the breastplate. Attach them to the two top corners of the breastplate.
"Fasten the two gold ropes to the rings at the top corners of the breastplate.
"Fasten the other ends of the ropes to the two settings on the shoulder straps of the ephod so that the breastplate hangs in front of it.
"Make two gold rings, and connect them to the other two corners of the breastplate on the inside edge next to the ephod.
"Make two more gold rings, and fasten them to the bottom of the shoulder straps on the front of the ephod. This will be close to the seam just above the belt of the ephod.
"Then the breastplate should be fastened by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord. Attach it just above the belt of the ephod. This will hold the breastplate in place.
"When Aaron goes into the holy place, he will carry the names of the sons of Israel over his heart as a continual reminder in Jehovah’s presence. He must do this by wearing the breast piece for decision-making.
Put the Urim and Thummim into the breast piece for decision-making. They, too, will be over Aaron’s heart when he comes into Jehovah’s presence. In this way when he is in Jehovah’s presence, Aaron will always be carrying over his heart the means for determining Jehovah’s decisions for the Israelites.
"Make the robe that is worn with the ephod entirely of violet material.
"Provide an opening for the head in the center with a reinforced edge like a leather collar all around it to keep it from tearing.
"Along the hem of the robe weave pomegranates of blue, purple, and red wool with a gold bell between each of them.
"Aaron should wear it when he serves as priest. The sound of the bells must be heard when he comes into and goes out of Jehovah’s presence in the holy place so that he will not die.
"Also make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engravings of a seal: Holy to Jehovah.
"Fasten it on a blue cord and on the turban. It should be at the front of the turban.
"It shall be on Aaron’s forehead. Aaron will take away the iniquity of the holy things that the sons of Israel consecrate. Concerning their holy gifts it will always be on his forehead that they may be accepted before Jehovah.
"Weave the tunic of checkered work of fine linen. Make a turban of fine linen and a sash, the work of a weaver.
"Make linen robes, belts, and turbans for Aaron’s sons. These clothes will give them dignity and honor.
"Dress your brother Aaron and his sons in these clothes and anoint them, ordain them, and set them apart to serve me as priests.
"Make linen undergarments to cover them down to their thighs.
"Aaron and his sons must wear them when they go into the tent of meeting or when they come near the altar to serve as priests in the holy place. They will be blameless and will not die. This is a long lasting law for him and his descendants.
Jehovah also said: "This is what you must do in order to consecrate set Aaron and his sons apart to serve me as priests: Take a young bull that has no defects and two rams that have no defects.
"Use the best wheat flour to make some unleavened bread. Bake some with olive oil, some without it, and some in the form of thin cakes brushed with oil.
"Put them in a basket and offer them to me when you sacrifice the bull and the two rams.
"Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the sacred tent of meeting and have them wash themselves.
"Aaron should dress in the priestly shirt and robe under the sacred vest. Put on the vest, the breast piece, and the sash.
"Put on his turban with its narrow strip of engraved gold.
"Ordain him by pouring olive oil on his head.
"Aaron’s sons should dress in their special shirts, caps and sashes.
"Then ordain them, because they and their descendants will have a long lasting priesthood.
"Lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent. Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head there.
"Slaughter the bull near my altar in front of the tent.
"Use a finger to smear some of its blood on each of the four corners of the altar. Pour out the rest of the blood on the ground next to the altar.
"Take all the fat that covers the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.
"Burn the bull’s meat, skin, and excrement outside the camp. It is an offering for sin.
"Take one of the rams and Aaron and his sons are to put their hands on its head.
"Slaughter the ram. Take its blood and sprinkle it all around the altar.
"Cut the ram in pieces. Wash its internal organs and its legs, and put them on top of the head and the other pieces.
"Burn the whole ram on the altar. It is burnt offering to Jehovah. The odor of this offering pleases me.
Take the other ram and Aaron and his sons are to put their hands on its head.
"Kill it and take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Sprinkle the rest of the blood all around the altar.
"Take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his clothes and on his sons and their clothes. He, his sons, and their clothes will then be dedicated to me.
"Remove the ram’s fat, the fat tail, the fat covering the internal organs, the fat attached to the liver, the two kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh.
"From the basket of bread which has been offered to me, take one loaf of each kind: one loaf made with olive oil and one made without it and one thin cake.
"Put all this food in the hands of Aaron and his sons and have them dedicate it to me as a special gift.
"The meat and bread are to be placed on the altar and sent up in smoke with a smell before Jehovah.
"You may eat the choice breast from this second ram, but you must first lift them up to show that this meat is dedicated to me.
"You shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering which was waved and which was offered from the ram of ordination, from the one that was for Aaron and from the one that was for his sons.
"It will be for Aaron and his sons as their long lasting portion from the sons of Israel. It is a heave offering. It will be a heave offering from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to Jehovah.
"The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him. They may wear them when they are anointed and ordained.
"For seven days the one of his sons who is priest in his stead shall put them on when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
"You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.
"Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket, at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
"They shall eat those things used for their atonement and their ordination and consecration. A layman shall not eat them, because they are holy.
"If any of the flesh of ordination or any of the bread remains until morning it should be burned with fire. It should not be eaten because it is holy.
"Do to Aaron and to his sons all that I have commanded you. Ordain them for seven days.
"Offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement each day. Purify the altar when you make atonement for it. Anoint it to consecrate it.
"Make atonement for the altar and consecrate it for seven days. Then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
"Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one year old lambs each day, continuously.
"Offer one lamb in the morning and offer the other lamb at twilight.
"Make an offering of eight cups of flour mixed with one quart of virgin olive oil with the first lamb. Offer one quart of wine for a drink offering with the other lamb.
"You will offer the other lamb at twilight. Offer it with the same grain offering and the same drink offering as in the morning, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
"It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the doorway of the tent of meeting before Jehovah. That is where I will meet with you to speak to you.
"I will meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be consecrated by my glory.
"I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to minister as priests to me.
"I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God.
"They shall know that I am Jehovah their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them. I am Jehovah their God!
"Build an altar out of acacia wood for burning incense.
"Make it eighteen inches square and thirty-six inches high. The horns that extend out of it and the altar should be made out of one piece of wood.
"Cover it all with pure gold, the top, the sides, and the horns. Put a gold molding around it.
"Make two gold rings. Place them below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles for carrying it.
"Make the poles out of acacia wood. Cover them with gold.
"Place the altar in front of the canopy that hangs over the ark containing the words of my covenant I will meet with you there in front of the throne of mercy that is on the ark.
"Aaron must burn sweet incense on this altar every morning when he takes care of the lamps.
"When Aaron lights the lamps at dusk he must burn incense. An incense offering must burn smoke constantly in Jehovah’s presence for generations to come.
"Do not burn any unauthorized incense on this altar or any burnt offerings or grain offerings. Do not pour a wine offering on it.
"Once a year Aaron must make atonement with Jehovah by putting blood on its horns. Once a year for generations to come blood from the offering must be placed on the altar to make atonement with Jehovah. It is most holy to Jehovah."
Jehovah again spoke to Moses:
"When you take a census of the people of Israel, each man is to pay me a price for his life. This to insure that no disaster will come on him while the census is being taken.
"Everyone included in the census must pay the required amount of money. It should be weighed according to the official standard. Everyone must pay this as an offering to me.
"Every man being counted in the census who is twenty years old or older is to pay me this amount.
"The rich man is not to pay more. The poor man is not to pay less, when they pay this amount for their lives.
"Collect this money from the people of Israel and spend it for the upkeep of the tent of meeting. This tax will be the payment for their lives. I will remember to protect them."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Make a copper basin with a bronze stand for washing. Put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and fill it with water.
"Aaron and his sons will use it for washing their hands and feet.
"Before they go into the tent of meeting, they must wash so that they will not die. Before they come near the altar to serve as priests and burn an offering by fire to Jehovah.
« They must wash their hands and feet, so that they will not die. This is a long lasting rule that they and their descendants are to observe."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Take top quality spices: twelve pounds of liquid myrrh, six pounds of sweet-smelling cinnamon, six pounds of sweet-smelling cane,
and twelve pounds of cassia, according to the official standard. Add one gallon of olive oil,
and make sacred anointing oil, mixed like perfume.
"This is for dedicating the tent and chest,
the table with its equipment, the lamp stand with its equipment, the incense altar with all its utensils,
the altar for sacrifices, and the large bowl with its stand.
"You will make them so holy that anyone who even touches them will become holy when you dedicate them this way.
"Sprinkle Aaron and his sons with this oil when you ordain them as my priests.
"Say this to the people of Israel: ‘ This oil must always be used in the ordination service of a priest. It is holy because it is dedicated to Jehovah.
"So treat it as holy! Do not use it for everyday purposes or mix any for yourselves.
"If you do, you will no longer belong to Jehovah’s people. ’"
Jehovah said to Moses: "Take one part fragrant spices and two kinds of gum resin and aromatic mollusk shells, and mix them with one part pure frankincense.
"Have a perfumer make it into fragrant incense, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
"Grind some of it into a fine powder. Put it in front of the ark containing the words of my covenant in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. You must treat it as most holy.
"Do not make any incense for yourselves using this formula. Treat it as holy to Jehovah.
"Anyone who prepares anything like it for his own enjoyment must be excluded from his people."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"I have called Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.
"I filled him with the Spirit of God my power. I gave him understanding, skill, and ability for every kind of artistic work.
"This is for planning skillful designs and working them in gold, silver, and copper.
"It is also for cutting jewels to be set and for carving wood and for every other kind of artistic work.
"I also appointed Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to help him. I have given every craftsman the skill necessary to make what I have commanded you:
the tent of meeting, the ark containing the words of my covenant with the throne of mercy on it, and all the other furnishings for the tent,
the table and the dishes, the pure gold lamp stand and all its utensils, the altar for incense,
the altar for burnt offerings and all its accessories, the basin with its stand,
the special clothes the holy clothes for the priest Aaron and the clothes for his sons when they serve as priests,
the anointing oil, and the sweet incense for the holy place. They will make all these things as I commanded you."
Jehovah also said to Moses:
"Speak to the people of Israel. Say: ‘ You must observe my Sabbaths. This is a sign between you and me throughout your generations that you may know that I am Jehovah, the one who sanctifies you.
"‘ You are to observe the Sabbath. It is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it will absolutely be put to death. Whoever does any work on it will be removed from his people.
"‘ Work may be done for six days. The seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest. It is holy to Jehovah. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day will definitely be put to death.
"‘ The Israelites must observe the Sabbath and celebrate the Sabbath throughout their generations as a long lasting covenant.
"‘ It is a long lasting sign between the people of Israel and me for the reason that Jehovah made heaven and earth in six days. Then He ceased from work and was refreshed on the seventh day. ’"
When God finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
The people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain. They gathered around Aaron. They said to him: "We do not know what has happened to Moses, the man who led us out of Egypt. Make gods to lead us."
Aaron replied: "Have your wives, sons, and daughters take off the gold earrings they are wearing. Bring them to me."
The people took off their gold earrings and handed them to Aaron.
After he worked on the gold with a tool, he made it into a statue of a calf. Then they said: "Israel, this is your god, who brought you out of Egypt."
Aaron built an altar in front of it when he saw what happened. Then he announced: "Tomorrow there will be a festival in Jehovah’s honor."
Early the next day the people sacrificed burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. After that they sat down to a feast, which turned into an orgy.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Go down there. Your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves.
"They have already turned from the way I commanded them to live. They made a statue of a calf for themselves. They have bowed down to it and offered sacrifices to it. They said: "Israel, here is your god who brought you out of Egypt. ’"
Jehovah added: "I have seen these people. They have an iron sinew stiff necked people are impossible to deal with.
"Now let me alone. Let my anger burn against them. I am so angry with them I am going to destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."
"But Moses pleaded with Jehovah his God. "Jehovah," he said, "why are you so angry with your people? These are your people whom you brought out of Egypt using your great power and mighty hand!
"Do not let the Egyptians say: ‘ He was planning all along to kill them in the mountains and wipe them off the face of the earth. That is why he brought them out of our land. ’ ’ Do not be so angry. Reconsider your decision to bring this disaster on your people.
"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. You took an oath, swearing on yourself. You told them: ‘ I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky. I will give to your descendants all the land I spoke of. It will be their long lasting possession. ’"
So Jehovah changed his mind and did not bring disaster on his people as he threatened.
Moses went back down the mountain. He carried the two stone tablets with the commandments written on both sides.
God made the tablets and engraved the commandments on them.
Joshua heard the people shouting and said to Moses: "I hear the sound of war in the camp."
Moses replied: "That does not sound like a shout of victory or a cry of defeat; it is the sound of singing."
Moses came close enough to the camp at the foot of the mountain to see the bull-calf and to see the people dancing. He became furious! He threw down the tablets he was carrying and broke them.
He took the bull-calf that they had made, melted it, ground it into fine powder, and mixed it with water. Then he made the people of Israel drink it.
Moses asked Aaron: "What did these people do to harm you? Why did you make them sin in this terrible way?"
Aaron said, "Do not be angry with me. You know the people as well as I do. They are determined to do evil.
"They said to me: ‘ That man Moses led us out of Egypt, but now we do not know what has happened to him. Make us a god to lead us. ’"
"Then I asked them to bring me their gold earrings. They took them off and gave them to me. I threw the gold into a fire, and out came this bull."
Moses saw that the people were naked. Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies.
Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said: "Who is on Jehovah’s side? Come to me. All the sons of Levi came to him."
He said to them, "Jehovah, the God of Israel says: ‘ Each man put his sword by his side. Go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp. Kill each one his brother, and each one his neighbor, and each one his kindred. ’"
The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. About three thousand men died that day.
Moses said: "Today you are ordained as Jehovah’s. God gave you a blessing today. Each of you fought with your own sons and brothers."
The next day Moses said to the people: "You have committed a serious sin. Now I will go up the mountain to Jehovah. Maybe I will be able to make a payment for your sin and make atonement with Jehovah for your sin."
So Moses went back to Jehovah and said: "These people have committed such a serious sin! They made a god out of gold for themselves.
"Will you forgive their sin? If not, please wipe me out of the book you have written."
Jehovah answered Moses: "I will wipe out of my book whoever sins against me.
"Now, go and lead the people to the place I told you about. My angel will go ahead of you. But on the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."
Jehovah killed people because they had Aaron make the calf.
Jehovah said to Moses: "You and the people you brought out of Egypt must leave this place. Go to the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with an oath, saying: ‘ I will give it to your descendants. ’"
"I will send an angel ahead of you. I will force out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
"Go to that land flowing with milk and honey. I will not be with you, because you are impossible to deal with. I would probably destroy you on the way."
The people heard this bad news and acted as if someone had died. No one wore any jewelry.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Tell the Israelites: You are impossible to deal with. If I were with you, I might destroy you at any time. Take off your jewelry and I will decide what to do with you."
The Israelites no longer wore their jewelry after they left Mount Horeb.
Moses used to take a tent and set it up far outside the camp. He called it the tent of meeting. Anyone who was seeking Jehovah’s will used to go outside the camp to the tent of meeting.
Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrances to their tents and watch Moses until he went in.
After Moses entered, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the door of the Tent. Jehovah would speak to Moses from the cloud.
The people would bow down as soon they saw the pillar of cloud at the door of the Tent.
Jehovah would speak with Moses in person intimately face to face just as someone speaks with a friend. Moses would then return to the camp. But the young man who was his helper, Joshua son of Nun, stayed in the Tent.
Moses said to Jehovah: "It is true that you have told me to lead these people to that land, but you did not tell me whom you would send with me. You said that you know me well and are pleased with me.
If you are, tell me your plans, so that I may serve you and continue to please you. Remember also that you have chosen this nation to be your own."
Jehovah replied: "I will go with you and give you peace."
Moses said: "If you are not going with us, please do not make us leave this place.
"If you do go with us, everyone will know that you are pleased with your people and with me. That way, we will be different from the rest of the people on earth."
Jehovah said to Moses: "I will do this thing of which you have spoken. You have found favor in my sight. I have known you by name.
Then Moses said: Please show me your glory!"
Jehovah said: "I will make all my goodness pass in front of you. I will call out my name, JEHOVAH. I will be kind to anyone I want to. I will be merciful to anyone I want to."
But he said: "You cannot see my face, because no one may see me and live."
Then Jehovah said: "Look, there is a place near me. Stand by this rocky cliff.
"When my glory passes by, I will put you in a crevice in the cliff and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
"Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back, but my face must not be seen."
Jehovah said to Moses: "Cut two more stone tablets like the first ones. I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets that you smashed.
"Be ready in the morning. Come up on Mount Sinai and present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.
"No man may come with you or even be seen anywhere on the mountain. Even the flocks and herds may not graze in front of this mountain."
Moses cut two more stone tablets. Early the next morning he carried them up Mount Sinai, just as Jehovah commanded.
Jehovah came down in a cloud and stood with him as Moses called upon the name of Jehovah!
Jehovah then passed in front of him and called out: "I, Jehovah, am a God who is full of compassion and pity. I am not easily angered and show great love and faithfulness.
"I keep my promise for thousands of generations and forgive evil and sin. But I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their fathers."
Moses hurried to bow low toward the earth and worship.
He prayed: "Jehovah, if you really are pleased with me, I pray that you will go with us. It is true that these people are sinful and rebellious. However, please forgive our sin and let us be your people."
Jehovah said: "Behold! I offer a covenant promise to perform signs and miracles for you that have never been done in all the earth. Neighboring nations will stand in fear and know that I was the one who did these marvelous things.
"I will force out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. You must do what I command you today.
"Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going. It will become a snare in your midst.
"Instead tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim.
"Do not worship any other god but Jehovah for his reputation is filled with zeal, and he is a God who demands exclusive devotion.
Otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land. They would commit spiritual immorality fornication with their gods and sacrifice to their gods. Someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice.
"You might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters might commit spiritual immorality fornication with their gods and cause your sons also to commit spiritual immorality with their gods.
"Do not make idol gods for yourself.
"Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. As I commanded you, you must eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib. This is because in that month you came out of Egypt.
"Every first male offspring is mine. The firstborn males of all your livestock, whether cattle, sheep, or goats are mine.
"It will cost you a sheep or a goat to buy back the firstborn donkey. If you do not buy it back, then you must break the donkey’s neck. You must buy back every firstborn of your sons. No one may come into my presence without an offering.
"You may work six days. On the seventh day you must not work. Even during the time of plowing or harvesting you must not work on this day.
"Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the first grain from your wheat harvest. Celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest at the end of the season.
"Three times a year all your men must come into the presence of the Sovereign Jehovah, the God of Israel.
"I will force nations out of your way and will expand your country’s borders. No one will want to take away your land while you are gone three times a year to Jehovah’s festivals.
"Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me at the same time you offer anything containing yeast. No part of the sacrifice at the Passover festival should be left over in the morning.
"I am Jehovah your God! You must bring the first part of your harvest to the place of worship. Do not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk."
Jehovah told Moses: "Put these laws in writing, as part of my agreement covenant with Israel."
Moses was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights. He did not eat bread or drink water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments Ten Words.
Moses came down from Mount Sinai. The two tablets of the testimony were in Moses’ hand as he came down from the mountain. Moses did not know that the skin of his face glowed because he spoke with God.
Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses and saw his face glowing. They were afraid to come near him.
Moses called to them. Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation came back to him. Then Moses spoke to them.
All the other Israelites came near him. He commanded them to do everything Jehovah told him on Mount Sinai.
Moses put a veil over his face when he finished speaking.
When Moses went into Jehovah’s presence to speak with him, he took off the veil until he came out. When he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
they would see that Moses’ face was glowing. Moses would put the veil back on until he went in again to speak with Jehovah.
Moses assembled the whole Israelite congregation and said to them: "These are the things Jehovah commanded you to do:
"You may work for six days. The seventh day is a holy day of worship a Sabbath. It is a day when you do not work. It is dedicated to Jehovah. Whoever does any work on this day should be put to death.
"Do not light a fire in your homes on the Sabbath day."
Moses spoke to all the people of Israel: "This is what Jehovah has commanded:
‘ Make an offering to Jehovah. Everyone who wishes to do so is to bring an offering of gold, silver, or copper.
‘ The offering could be of fine linen, blue, purple, and red wool; cloth made of goats’ hair;
rams’ skin dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood;
oil for the lamps, spices; balsam oil for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense.
The offering could also be carnelians and other jewels to be set in the High Priest’s ephod and in his breast piece.
‘ All the skilled workers among you are to come and make everything that Jehovah commanded:
the Tent, its covering and its outer covering, its hooks and its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases;
the Covenant Box, its poles, its lid, and the curtain to screen it off;
the table, its poles, and all its equipment; the bread offered to God;
the lamp stand for the light and its equipment; the lamps with their oil;
the altar for burning incense and its poles; the anointing oil; the sweet incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tent;
the altar on which to burn offerings, with its bronze grating attached, its poles, and all its equipment; the washbasin and its base;
the curtains for the enclosure, its posts and bases; the curtain for the entrance of the enclosure;
the Tent pegs and ropes for the Tent and the enclosure;
and the garments the priests are to wear when they serve in the Holy Place---the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons. ’"
Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel left Moses.
Those who were willing and whose hearts moved them brought their contributions to Jehovah. The gifts were used to construct the tent of meeting, to pay other expenses, and to make the holy clothes.
All willing, men and women alike, brought all kinds of gold jewelry: pins, brooches, earrings, signet rings, and pendants. They offered these gifts of gold to Jehovah.
Those who had violet, purple, or bright red yarn, fine linen, goats’ hair, rams’ skins dyed red, or fine leather brought them.
Those who could give silver or copper brought it as their contribution to Jehovah. Those who had acacia wood that could be used in the construction brought it.
All the skilled women brought fine linen thread and thread of blue, purple, and red wool, which they made.
They also made thread of goats’ hair.
The leaders brought different kinds of jewels to be sewn on the special clothes and the breast piece for the high priest.
And the spice and the oil for the light, and the holy anointing oil and the sweet perfume balsam oil.
The people of Israel, every man and woman whose hearts were willing, gave their offerings freely to Jehovah. This was for the work that Jehovah gave Moses orders to have done.
Then Moses said to the sons of Israel: "Jehovah has called by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.
"He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship.
"He is a master artist familiar with gold, silver, and copper.
"He knows how to cut and set stones and how to work with wood. He is an expert in all trades.
"Jehovah also gave Bezalel and Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan the ability to teach others.
"Jehovah made these men highly skilled in all trades. They can do the work of jewelers, carpenters, and designers. They know how to embroider violet, purple and bright red yarn on fine linen. They know how to weave yarn on a loom. They can do all kinds of trades. They are master artists.
Moses continued speaking: "Bezalel and Oholiab will do the work as Jehovah commanded. They will do this with the help of every other craftsman to whom Jehovah has given the necessary skills and talents. They will know how to do all the work for constructing the holy place."
Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman to whom Jehovah gave these skills and who was willing to come and do the work.
Moses provided them with all the contributions the Israelites brought for the work of constructing the holy place. Plus, the people still kept bringing him voluntary freewill offerings every morning.
Then the skilled men who were doing the work went
to Moses. They said: "The people are bringing more than is needed for the work Jehovah commanded to be done."
Moses sent a command throughout the camp, saying: "No one is to make any further contribution for the sacred Tent." So the people did not bring any more.
What had already been brought was sufficient to finish all the work.
The most skilled men among those doing the work made the Tent of Jehovah’s presence. They made it out of ten pieces of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures.
Each curtain was forty-two feet long and six feet wide. They were all the same size.
Five of the curtains were sewn together. The other five were also sewn together.
They made fifty violet loops along the edge of the end curtain in each set.
They placed the loops opposite sides of each other.
They also made fifty gold fasteners. They used them to link the two sets of curtains together so that the inner tent was a single unit.
Eleven curtains were made of goats’ hair to form an outer tent over the inner tent.
Each of the eleven curtains was forty-five feet long and six feet wide.
Five of the curtains were sewn together into one set, and the remaining six into another set.
They made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in each set.
Fifty bronze fasteners were also made to link the inner tent together as a single unit.
They made a cover out of rams’ skins that had been dyed red for the outer tent, and over that they put a cover made of fine leather.
A framework for the inner tent was made out of acacia wood.
Each frame was fifteen feet long and twenty-seven inches wide.
Each had two identical pegs. They made all the frames for the inner tent this same way.
They made twenty frames for the south side of the inner tent.
Then they made forty silver sockets placed at the bottom of the twenty frames. There were two sockets at the bottom of each frame for the two pegs.
Twenty frames were also made for the north side of the inner tent.
Forty silver sockets were prepared with two at the bottom of each frame.
They made six frames for the far end, the west side.
They made two frames for each of the corners at the far end of the inner tent.
They were held together at the bottom and held tightly at the top by a single ring. Both corner frames were made this way.
There were eight frames with sixteen silver sockets. There were two at the bottom of each frame.
They also made crossbars out of acacia wood. Five were for the frames on one side of the inner tent,
five were for those on the other side, and five were for the frames on the far side of the inner tent, the west side.
The middle crossbar was made so that it ran from one end to the other, halfway up the frames.
They covered the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also covered the crossbars with gold.
They made the canopy out of violet, purple, and bright red yarn and fine linen yarn. A cherubim angel design was creatively worked into the fabric.
Four posts of acacia wood were prepared for it. They covered them with gold. They made gold hooks for the posts. They cast four silver bases for them.
They made a screen out of fine linen yarn for the entrance to the outer tent. It was embroidered with violet, purple, and bright red yarn.
They also made five posts with hooks for hanging the screen. They covered the tops of the posts and the bands with gold. The five bases for the posts were made of copper.
Bezalel made the ark out of acacia wood forty-five inches long, twenty-seven inches wide, and twenty-seven inches high.
He covered it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold molding around it.
He cast four gold rings for its four feet, two rings on each side.
The carrying poles he made with acacia wood. He covered them with gold.
Then he put them through the rings that were on each side of the Ark.
He made a lid of pure gold, forty-five inches long and twenty-seven inches wide.
He made two cherubim of hammered gold,
one for each end of the lid. He made them so that they formed one piece with the lid, one cherub at each end.
The cherubim had their wings spread upward. They covered the mercy seat with their wings. The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat and toward each other.
He made the table of acacia wood. It was thirty-six inches long and eighteen inches wide and twenty-seven inches high.
He covered it with pure gold, and made a gold molding that went all around it.
The rim he made for it was a handbreadth all around. He also made gold molding all around it.
He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.
The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles for carrying the table.
These poles were made out of acacia wood and were covered with gold.
He made plates, dishes, bowls, and pitchers to be used for pouring wine offerings on the table. All of them were made out of pure gold.
He made the lamp stand out of pure gold. The lamp stand, its base, and its shaft, as well as the flower cups, buds, and petals were hammered out of one piece of gold.
There were three branches on each of its two sides, for a total of six branches.
There were three decorative almond blossoms on each branch.
And there were four on the lamp stand.
A blossom was placed where each pair of branches came out from the lamp stand.
The lamp stand, including its branches and decorative flowers, was made from a single piece of hammered pure gold.
He made seven its seven lamps including the snuffers and fire trays out of pure gold.
The lamp stand and all the utensils were made out of seventy-five pounds of pure gold.
He made an altar out of acacia wood for burning incense. It was eighteen inches square and thirty-six inches high. The horns and altar were made out of one piece of wood.
All of it was covered with pure gold, the top, the sides, and the horns. He put a gold molding around it.
He made two gold rings and put them below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles for carrying it.
Then the poles were made out of acacia wood and covered with gold.
A perfumer made the holy oil to be used for anointing and for the pure, sweet incense.
He made the altar for burnt offerings out of acacia wood seven and one half feet square and four and one half feet high.
Then he placed a horn at each of its four corners. He made the four horns and the altar out of one piece of wood covered with copper.
He also made all the equipment for the altar: the pans, the shovels, the bowls, the hooks, and the fire pans. All this equipment was made of copper.
A copper grating was also made. It was placed under the rim of the altar, so that it reached halfway up the altar.
A copper ring was attached beneath the ledge at the four corners to put the poles through.
After that he covered two acacia wood poles with copper and
put them through the rings for carrying the altar, which was shaped like an open box.
He made the laver basin of copper with its base of copper, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
He made the courtyard. The south side curtains of the courtyard were fine twisted linen, one hundred and fifty feet long.
The courtyard had twenty pillars, and twenty sockets, made of copper. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
The north side was also one hundred and fifty feet long with twenty posts and twenty copper bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver.
The west side was seventy-five feet long. It had curtains hung on ten posts set in ten bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver.
The entrance was on the east side. The enclosure was also twenty-five yards wide.
The curtains for the gate were twenty-two and one half feet long, with their three pillars and their three sockets,
The curtains around the courtyard were all made out of fine linen yarn.
The bases for the posts were made of copper. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver. The tops of the posts were covered with silver. And the bands on all the posts of the courtyard were made of silver.
The screen for the entrance to the courtyard was made of violet, purple, and bright red yarn embroidered on fabric made from fine linen yarn. It was thirty feet long and seven and one half feet high, just like the curtains of the courtyard.
The screen hung on four posts set in four copper bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver. The tops of the posts were covered with silver.
The pegs for the tent and the surrounding courtyard were made of copper.
This is the inventory of the tent, the Tent of Testimony. An inventory was ordered by Moses and carried out by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, son of the priest Aaron.
Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, made everything Jehovah commanded Moses.
Bezalel was a jeweler, carpenter, designer, and he knew how to embroider violet, purple, and bright red yarn on fine linen. His assistant was Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan.
All the gold from the offerings presented to Jehovah used in building the holy place weighed over two thousand one hundred and ninety three pounds using the standard weight of the holy place.
The silver collected when the census of the community was taken weighed seven thousand five hundred and forty four pounds using the standard weight of the holy place.
This amounted to one-fifth of an ounce per person, for everyone counted who was at least twenty years old. There were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty people.
He used seven thousand five hundred pounds of silver to cast the one hundred bases for the holy place and the canopy. That came to seventy-five pounds per base.
Bezalel used forty-four pounds of silver to make the hooks and bands for the posts and the coverings for the tops of the posts.
The offerings presented to Jehovah weighted five thousand three hundred and ten pounds.
He used this to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the copper altar with its copper grate and all its accessories,
the bases all around the courtyard, the bases for the entrance to the courtyard, all the pegs for the tent, and all the pegs for the surrounding courtyard.
From the violet, purple, and bright red yarn they made special clothes worn for official duties in the holy place. They also made the holy clothes for Aaron. They obeyed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses.
The ephod was made out of fine linen yarn and gold, violet, purple, and bright red yarn.
The gold was hammered into thin sheets and cut up. They twisted the gold into threads, which they creatively worked into each strand of the violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and throughout the fine linen.
From this they made two shoulder straps for the ephod and attached them to its sides, so that it could be fastened.
The finely woven belt, made of the same materials, was attached to the ephod so as to form one piece with it. This was as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
They prepared the carnelians and mounted them in gold settings. They were skillfully engraved with the names of the twelve sons of Jacob.
They placed them on the shoulder straps of the ephod to represent the twelve tribes of Israel. Again, this was just as Jehovah commanded Moses.
The breast piece was made of the same materials as the ephod and with similar embroidery.
It was square and folded double, nine inches long and nine inches wide.
They mounted four rows of precious stones on it. Ruby was mounted on the first row along with topaz, and garnet.
Included in the second row was an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
The third row contained a turquoise, an agate, and an amethyst.
The fourth row contained a beryl, a carnelian, and jasper. These were mounted in gold settings.
Each of the twelve stones had engraved on it the name of one of the sons of Jacob, in order to represent the twelve tribes of Israel.
They made chains out of pure gold, twisted like ropes. These were for the breastplate.
Two gold settings and two gold rings were prepared and attached, the two rings to the top two corners of the breast piece.
They fastened the two gold ropes to the rings at the top corners of the breastplate.
They fastened the other ends of the ropes to the two settings on the shoulder straps of the ephod. The breastplate hung in front of it.
They made two gold rings and fastened them to the other two corners of the breast piece on the inside edge next to the ephod.
They made two more gold rings and fastened them to the bottom of the shoulder straps on the front of the ephod. This was close to the seam just above the belt of the ephod.
Finally they fastened the breast piece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord. So the breast piece was attached just above the belt of the ephod and was held in place. They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses.
They made the robe that is worn with the ephod. It was woven entirely of violet yarn.
The opening in the center of the robe had a finished edge, somewhat like a leather collar, all around it to keep it from tearing.
On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and fine yarn.
They wove inner robes out of fine linen for Aaron and his sons.
They also made the chief priest’s turban and the other beautiful turbans out of fine linen. They made the undergarments and belt out of fine linen yarn.
The belt was embroidered with violet, purple, and bright red yarn. They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses.
The flower-shaped medallion, the holy crown, was fashioned out of pure gold. The statement: HOLY TO JEHOVAH was engraved on it.
They fastened a violet cord to it and tied it on top of the turban. They followed Jehovah’s instructions to Moses.
So all the work on the inner tent of the tent of meeting was now done. The Israelites obeyed all Jehovah’s instructions to Moses.
They brought everything to Moses: the inner tent, the outer tent and all its furnishings, the fasteners, frames, crossbars, posts, sockets,
the cover made of rams’ skins dyed red, the cover made of fine leather, the canopy over the Ark,
the Ark containing the words of God’s covenant with its poles and the throne of mercy,
the table with all the dishes, the bread of the presence,
the pure gold lamp stand with its lamps in a row and all its utensils, the olive oil for the lamps,
the gold altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the entrance to the tent,
the copper altar with its copper grate, its poles, and all its accessories, the basin with its stand,
the curtains for the courtyard, the posts, bases, and screen for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes and pegs, all the equipment needed for the service of the inner tent for tent of meeting;
the special clothes worn when serving as priests in the holy place, both the holy clothes for the priest Aaron and the clothes for his sons when serving as priests.
The Israelites did all the work according to Jehovah’s instructions to Moses.
Moses inspected all the work. He saw that they had followed Jehovah’s instructions. So Moses blessed them.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting on the first day of the first month of the year.
"Place the Ark containing the words of my covenant inside it, and hang the canopy over the ark.
"Bring in the table and place the equipment on it. Also bring the lamp stand and set up the lamps on it.
"Put the gold altar for burning incense in front of the Covenant Box and hang the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
"Place the altar for burning offerings in front of the Tabernacle.
"Set the washbasin between the Tabernacle and the altar and fill it with water.
"Put up the surrounding enclosure and hang the curtain at its entrance.
"Then dedicate the Tabernacle and all its equipment by anointing it with the sacred oil, and it will be holy.
"Dedicate the altar and all its equipment by anointing it, and it will be completely holy.
"Also dedicate the washbasin and its base in the same way.
"Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tabernacle, and have them take a ritual bath.
"Dress Aaron in the priestly garments and anoint him. Consecrate him so that he can serve me as priest.
"Bring his sons and put the shirts on them.
"Anoint them just as you anointed their father that they can serve me as priests. This anointing will make them priests for generations to come."
Moses did everything just as Jehovah commanded.
The Tent of Jehovah’s presence was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year after they left Egypt.
When Moses set up the tent, he put the sockets in place, put up the frames, inserted the crossbars, and set up the posts.
He spread the outer tent over the inner tent and put the cover on top. Moses followed Jehovah’s instructions.
He took the words of God’s promise covenant and put them in the ark. He put the poles on the ark and placed the throne of mercy on top of the ark.
Then he brought the ark into the tent and hung the canopy over it to mark off where the ark was. Moses followed Jehovah’s instructions.
Moses put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tent outside the canopy.
He arranged the bread on the table in Jehovah’s presence, following Jehovah’s instructions.
He placed the lamp stand in the tent of meeting opposite the table, on the south side of the tent.
He set the lighted lamps in Jehovah’s presence, following Jehovah’s instructions.
Moses put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the canopy.
He burned sweet incense on it, following Jehovah’s instructions.
Then he put up the screen at the entrance to the tent.
He put the altar for burnt offerings at the entrance to the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. He sacrificed burnt offerings and grain offerings on it. Moses followed Jehovah’s instructions.
He put the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
Moses, Aaron, and his sons used this water to wash their hands and feet.
They washed whenever they went into the tent of meeting or whenever they approached the altar. Moses obeyed Jehovah’s instructions.
He set up the courtyard around the tent and the altar and put up the screen at the entrance to the courtyard. At last Moses finished the work.
The column of smoke then covered the tent of meeting. The glory of Jehovah filled the tent.
Moses could not go into the tent of meeting because the smoke settled on it and the glory of Jehovah filled the tent.
In all their travels, when the column of smoke moved from the tent, the Israelites would break camp.
But if the column did not move, they would not break camp.
Jehovah’s column of smoke stayed over the tent during the day. There was fire in the smoke at night. This way all the Israelites could see the column throughout their travels.
Jehovah called to Moses. He spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, He said:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ When you bring an offering to Jehovah, bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock.
"‘ If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, it should be a male without defect. He shall offer it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.
"‘ He should lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering. It may then be accepted for him to make atonement with Jehovah on his behalf.
"‘ Slaughter the bull in Jehovah’s presence. Aaron's sons, the priests, will offer the blood. They will throw it against all sides of the altar that is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
"‘ Skin the burnt offering, and cut it into pieces.
"‘ The sons of the priest Aaron will start a fire on the altar and lay the wood on the fire.
"‘ Aaron's sons, the priests, will also lay the pieces, the head, and the fat on top of the wood burning on the altar.
"‘ Wash the internal organs and legs. The priest will then burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"‘ Should you are offer one of your sheep or goats; it must be a male without any defects.
"‘ Slaughter it on the north side of the altar. The priests should throw its blood on all four sides of the altar.
"‘ After you cut it up, the officiating priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire.
"‘ Wash the internal organs and the hind legs. The priest will present the sacrifice to Jehovah and burn all of it on the altar. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to Jehovah.
"‘ If you are offering a bird as a burnt offering, it must be a dove or a pigeon.
"‘ A priest will take the bird to the copper altar. He will wring its neck and put its head on the fire. Then he will drain out its blood on one side of the altar,
"‘ Remove the bird's crop with its feathers, and throw them on the ash heap at the east side of the altar.
"‘ Finally, he will take the bird by its wings, tear it partially open, and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases Jehovah.
"‘ When you present an offering of grain to Jehovah, you must first grind it into flour. You must put oil and incense on it.
"‘ Give it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest will take a handful of the flour and oil and all of the incense and burn it on the altar as a memorial. It is all offered by fire to Jehovah. The odor of this food offering is pleasing to Jehovah.
"‘ The rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is most holy and set apart from Jehovah’s offering by fire.
"‘ If your grain offering has been baked in an oven, it must be rings of unleavened bread made of flour mixed with olive oil or wafers of unleavened bread brushed with oil.
"‘ If your grain offering is prepared in a frying pan, it, too, will be unleavened bread made of flour mixed with oil.
"‘ Break it into pieces and pour oil over it. It is a grain offering.
"‘ When your grain offering is prepared in a skillet, it will be made of flour with oil.
"‘ Bring Jehovah the grain offering prepared in any of these ways. Offer it to the priest who will bring it to the altar.
"‘ To show that the whole offering belongs to me, the priest will lay part of it on the altar. He will send it up in smoke and fire with a smell that pleases Jehovah.
"‘ The rest of the offering belongs to the priests. It is very holy, since it is taken from the food offered to Jehovah.
"‘ Every grain offering you bring to Jehovah must be made without yeast. Do not use yeast or honey in food offered to Jehovah.
"‘ Bring them to Jehovah as an offering of first fruits. Do not offer them on the altar as a soothing aroma.
"‘ Season every grain offering with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering. All of your offerings must have salt.
"‘ When you bring a grain offering of early-ripened things to Jehovah, you should bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, grits of new growth, for the grain offering of your early-ripened things.
"‘ Put oil and incense on it. It is a grain offering.
"‘ The priest will burn the flour, oil, and all the incense as a reminder. It is an offering by fire to Jehovah.
"‘ If your sacrifice is a fellowship offering of cattle in Jehovah’s presence, it must be a male or female animal that has no defects.
"‘ Put your hand on the head of the animal and kill it at the entrance of the Tent of Jehovah’s presence. Then Aaron’s sons the priests must throw the blood against all four sides of the altar.
"‘ Offer all of the fat on the animal's insides as a sacrifice of the peace offering made by fire to Jehovah.
"‘ Also use the lower part of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat.
"‘ Some of the priests will lay these pieces on the altar and send them up in smoke with a smell that pleases me, together with the sacrifice that is offered to Jehovah.
"‘ If your sacrifice is a fellowship offering of sheep to Jehovah, you must bring a male or female animal that has no defects.
"‘ If your offering is a lamb, you must bring it to Jehovah.
"‘ Place your hand on the animal's head. Slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Aaron's sons will throw the blood against the altar on all sides.
"‘ Take the fat from the fellowship offering and offer it by fire to Jehovah. Remove all the fat from the tail and the fat that covers the internal organs.
"‘ Remove the two kidneys with the fat on them along with the lobe of the liver.
"‘ The priest must burn the offering on the altar. It is food, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
"‘ When you offer a goat, offer it before Jehovah.
"‘ Put your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent. The priests will throw its blood against all four sides of the altar.
"‘ Offer all of the fat on the animal's insides.
"‘ Also the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys.
"‘ The priest will burn them on the altar. It is food, an offering by fire to Jehovah. It is a soothing aroma. All the fat belongs to Jehovah.
"‘ This is a long lasting law for generations to come wherever you live. Never eat any fat or blood. ’"
Jehovah commanded Moses
to tell the people of Israel: "If a person sins unintentionally and does not keep Jehovah’s commandments he would have to observe the following rules:
"If it is the High Priest who sins and brings guilt on the people, he should present a young bull without any defects and sacrifice it to Jehovah for his sin.
"The priest must lead the bull to the entrance of the sacred tent. He must lay his hand on its head and kill it there.
"He will take a bowl of the blood inside the tent,
dip a finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of it seven times toward the sacred chest behind the curtain.
"In my presence, he will smear some of the blood on each of the four corners of the incense altar, before pouring out the rest at the foot of the copper altar near the entrance to the tent.
"He must remove from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails,
and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys
"It is to be removed from the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering.
"But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse,
"He is to bring the rest of the bull to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out. There he will burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.
"If the whole congregation of Israel commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things that Jehovah commands not to be done they become guilty.
"When the sin they have committed becomes known the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd. This is for a sin offering. Bring it before the Tent of Meeting.
"The elders of the congregation will place their hands on the bull's head in Jehovah’s presence. One of them will slaughter it in Jehovah’s presence.
"Then the anointed priest will bring some of the bull's blood into the Tent of Meeting.
"The priest will dip his finger in some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times in Jehovah’s presence in front of the veil.
"He will put some blood on the horns of the altar in Jehovah’s presence in the Tent of Meeting. He will pour the remaining blood at the bottom of the altar. This is for burnt offerings at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
"He will remove all the fat and burn it on the altar.
"He will do the same thing with this bull that he did with the bull used as the offering for sin. So the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the people. They will be forgiven.
"He will take the bull outside the camp and burn it the same way he burned the first bull. It is an offering for sin for the community.
"When a ruler sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of Jehovah’s commands without intending to,
as soon as the sin is called to his attention, the priest will bring as his offering a male goat without any defects.
"He will place his hand on the goat's head. He will slaughter it in Jehovah’s presence where he slaughters animals for burnt offerings. It is an offering for sin.
"The priest will then take some of the blood of the offering for sin with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar for burnt offerings.
"He will burn all the fat on the altar the same way the fat of the fellowship offering is burned. The priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace for what the leader did wrong. The leader will be forgiven.
"When a common person unintentionally does something wrong, even one thing forbidden by Jehovah’s commandments, he will be guilty.
"When he learns what he has done wrong, he must bring a female goat that has no defects as his offering for what he has done wrong.
"He will place his hand on the animal's head and slaughter it where animals for burnt offerings are slaughtered.
"The priest will take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour the rest of the blood out at the bottom of the altar.
"He will remove all the fat the same way it is removed from the peace offering. The priest will burn it on the altar for a soothing aroma to Jehovah. So the priest will make peace with Jehovah for that person. That person will be forgiven.
"If someone brings a lamb as his offering for sin, he must bring a female that has no defects.
"He will place his hand on the animal's head and slaughter it where he slaughters animals for burnt offerings.
"Then the priest will take some of the blood from the offering for sin with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings. He will pour the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar.
"He will remove all the fat the same way the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings. Then the priest will burn it on the altar with the offering by fire to Jehovah. Then the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for what that person did wrong. That person will be forgiven.
Jehovah continued: "If you are a witness under oath who refuses to tell what you saw or what you know, you are sinning and will be punished.
"If you touch anything unclean such as an unclean dead body of a wild or tame animal or the body of an unclean, swarming creature and then ignore what you did, you are unclean and will be guilty.
"If you become unclean by touching human uncleanness of any kind and then ignore it knowing what you did you will be guilty.
"When you pledge a vow in haste about what you will or will not do, as some people do, and then ignore it; although you know what you said, you will be guilty.
"So if you are guilty of any of these sins, you must confess it.
"Bring your guilt offering to Jehovah for the sin you committed. It must be a female sheep or goat as an offering for sin. Then the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for what you did wrong.
"If you cannot afford a sheep, you must bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to Jehovah as a guilt offering for the sin you committed. One will be an offering for sin. The other will be a burnt offering.
"Bring them to the priest. He will sacrifice the offering for sin first. He will break the bird's neck without pulling its head off.
"He will sprinkle some of the blood from the offering for sin on the side of the altar. The rest of the blood will be drained at the bottom of the altar. It is an offering for sin.
"Following the proper procedures he will sacrifice the second bird as a burnt offering. The priest will pay compensation and make peace with Jehovah for what you did wrong.
"If you cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, bring eight cups of flour as an offering for the sin you committed. Never put olive oil on it or add incense to it. This is because it is an offering for sin.
"Bring it to the priest. The priest will take a handful of it. He will burn it as a reminder on top of the offering by fire to Jehovah on the altar. It is an offering for sin.
"The priest will pay compensation and make peace with Jehovah for your sin what you did wrong. You will be forgiven. The offering will belong to the priest like the grain offering."
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"If any of you fail to do your duty by unintentionally doing something wrong with any of Jehovah’s holy things, bring a guilt offering to Jehovah. It must be a ram that has no defects or its value in silver weighed according to the official standards of the holy place.
"You must make the payments you have failed to hand over and must pay an additional twenty percent. Give it to the priest. The priest will offer the animal as a sacrifice for your sin. You will be forgiven.
"If any of you sin unintentionally by breaking any of Jehovah’s commandments, you are guilty and must pay the penalty.
"Bring to the priest as a repayment offering a male sheep or goat without any defects. Its value is to be determined according to the official standard. The priest shall offer the sacrifice for the sin that you committed unintentionally. You will be forgiven.
"It is a repayment offering for the sin you committed against Jehovah."
Jehovah gave the following regulations to Moses:
"If any of you sin against Jehovah by failing to do your duty, if you lie to your neighbor about something you were supposed to take care of or if you lie about something stolen or seized from your neighbor, you are sinning and will be guilty.
"If you find something that someone lost and lie about it under oath, or commit any other sin like this,
you have sinned and are guilty. Return what you stole or seized, what you were supposed to take care of, the lost item you found,
"Then bring your guilt offering to Jehovah. Bring a ram that has no defects or its value in money. Bring it to the priest.
"The priest will pay compensation for your wrong and make peace with Jehovah. Then you will be forgiven for whatever you did that made you guilty."
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses,
"Command Aaron and his sons: ‘ These are the instructions for the burnt offering that stays on the altar overnight while the altar fire is kept burning.
"‘ The priest must put on his linen clothes. This includes linen undergarments. Then he will remove the ashes left on the altar from the fire that consumed the burnt offering and will put them next to the altar.
"‘ He will take off these clothes and put on some others. He will take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp.
"‘ The fire must always be burning on the altar. It must never go out. The priest will burn wood on it every morning. He will lay the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat of the fellowship offering.
"‘ The fire must always be burning on the altar. It must never go out.
"‘ This is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it in the presence of Jehovah in front of the altar.
"‘ One of them will lift up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering. Using its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he will offer it up in smoke on the altar. It will be a soothing aroma and a memorial offering to Jehovah.
"‘ Any thing left is for Aaron and his sons to eat. It will be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place. They must eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
"‘ Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it. It is a long lasting ordinance throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to Jehovah. Whoever touches them will become consecrated. ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to present to Jehovah on the day when he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
"Prepare it with oil on a griddle. Stir it well and bring it. Present the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"The anointed priest who will be in his place among his sons will offer it. By a long lasting ordinance it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to Jehovah.
"Every grain offering made by a priest must be completely burned. It must not be eaten."
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Tell Aaron and his sons: ‘ These are the instructions for the offering for sin. The offering for sin must be slaughtered in Jehovah’s presence. It is very holy.
"‘ The priest who makes the offering for sin will eat it in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. This is in the same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
"‘ Everything that touches its meat will be holy. If blood gets on someone's clothes, he must wash them in a holy place.
"‘ The piece of pottery in which the offering for sin is cooked must be broken into pieces. The copper kettle in which the offering for sin is cooked must be scoured and rinsed with water.
"‘ Every male among the priests may eat the offering for sin. It is very holy.
"‘ The offering for sin must not be eaten if some of the blood was brought into the holy place in the Tent of Meeting to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah. It must be burned.
"‘ These are the instructions for the guilt offering. It is very holy.
"‘ It should be slaughtered in the same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. A priest will throw the blood against all sides of the altar.
"‘ He will offer all the fat, the fat from the tail, the fat covering the internal organs.
"‘ That includes the two kidneys with the fat on them. He will also remove the lobe of the liver along with the kidneys.
The priest will burn them on the altar. It is a guilt offering by fire to Jehovah.
"‘ Every male among the priests may eat it. It will be eaten in a holy place. It is very holy.
"‘ The same instructions apply to the offering for sin and the guilt offering. Both offerings belong to the priest to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah.
"‘ The skin of the burnt offering belongs to the priest who sacrifices it.
"‘ Every grain offering, whether baked in an oven or prepared in a skillet or a frying pan, belongs to the priest who offers it.
"‘ Every grain offering, whether mixed with olive oil or dry, will be shared equally by all of Aaron's sons.
"‘ These are the instructions for the fellowship offering that you must bring to Jehovah.
"‘ If you offer it as a thank offering, you must also bring rings of unleavened bread mixed with oil, wafers of unleavened bread brushed with oil, and loaves made from flour mixed well with oil.
"‘ In addition to these rings of bread, you must bring leavened bread with yeast along with your fellowship offering of thanksgiving.
"‘ He will present one of every offering as a contribution to Jehovah. It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
"‘ The flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings will be eaten on the day of his offering. He should not leave any of it over until morning.
"‘ If the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice as well as on the next day.
"‘ Anything left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned.
"‘ If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, he who offers it will not be accepted. It will not be considered for his benefit. It will be an offensive thing, and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity.
"‘ The flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten. It should be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat such flesh.
"‘ The person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belong to Jehovah, in his uncleanness, that person will be cut off from his people.
"‘ When someone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to Jehovah, that person shall be cut off from his people. ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ Never eat any fat from bulls, sheep, or goats.
"‘ The fat from an animal that dies naturally or is killed by wild animals you may use for any other purpose. However, you must not eat it.
"‘ Those who eat the fat from an animal they sacrificed by fire to Jehovah must be excluded from the people.
"‘ Never eat the blood of any bird or animal no matter where you live.
"‘ Those who eat any blood must be excluded from the people. ’"
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ Anyone who offers Jehovah a fellowship offering must bring a part of that sacrifice as a gift to Jehovah.
"‘ Bring the sacrifices by fire made to Jehovah. Bring the fat with the breast. Take the breast and present it to Jehovah.
"‘ The priest will burn the fat on the altar. However, the breast will belong to Aaron and his sons.
"‘ You will also give the priest the right thigh as a contribution.
"‘ When any of Aaron's sons offer the blood and fat of the fellowship offering, the right thigh will belong to him as his share.
"‘ I have taken the breast and thigh that was presented to me from the contribution offering from the Israelites. I have given them to the priest Aaron and his sons. This is a long lasting law for generations to come.
"‘ This is the share for Aaron and his sons from the sacrifices by fire made to Jehovah. It was given to them on the day Moses ordained them to serve Jehovah as priests. ’"
Jehovah commanded the Israelites to give it to them on the day he anointed them. This is a long lasting law for generations to come.
These are the instructions for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the offering for sin, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the fellowship offering.
On Mount Sinai Jehovah gave Moses commands about these offerings. At the same time he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to him in the Sinai Desert.
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Bring Aaron and his sons, the priests' clothes, the anointing oil, the bull that will be the offered for sin, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread.
"Gather the entire congregation at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."
Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. All the people gathered assembled at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
Moses announced to the congregation: "Jehovah has commanded that this is what you must do!"
Moses had Aaron and his sons come forward. Then he washed them with water.
He clothed Aaron with the embroidered tunic and tied the sash around him. He also dressed him in the linen robe that is worn with the ephod. He fastened the ephod to it.
Then he placed the breastplate on him and he placed the Urim and Thummim.
He put the turban on Aaron’s head and fastened the gold medallion, the holy crown, to the front of the turban as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
Moses took the anointing oil to anoint the tent and everything in it and dedicate them.
He sprinkled the altar seven times. He anointed the altar; it’s utensils, the washbasin and its pedestal. This made them holy.
He also poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to set him apart for his holy duties.
Next, Moses dressed the sons of Aaron. He put shirts on them; put sashes around their waists, and tied caps on their heads, just as Jehovah commanded.
Moses brought the young bull for the sin offering. Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head.
Moses killed it and took some of the blood. Using his finger he put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, in order to dedicate it. He then poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. In this way he dedicated it and purified it.
Moses took all the fat on the internal organs. He took the best part of the liver, and the kidneys with the fat on them, and burned it all on the altar.
Finally, he took the skin and the flesh of the bull, together with the food still in its stomach, and burned them outside the camp, just as Jehovah commanded.
Moses led out the ram for the sacrifice to please Jehovah. After Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head,
Moses slaughtered the ram and splattered its blood against the four sides of the altar.
The ram was cut into pieces. Moses burned the head with the other pieces and the fat.
He brought the second ram for the ordination offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram's head.
Moses slaughtered it. He took some of the blood, and put it on Aaron's right ear lobe, on his right thumb, and on the big toe of his right foot.
Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward. He put some of the blood on their right ear lobes, on their right thumbs, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses threw the rest of the blood against all the sides of the altar.
He took the fat from the tail, all the fat on the internal organs, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh.
He took a loaf of unleavened bread, a ring of bread made with olive oil. He took a wafer from the basket of unleavened bread in Jehovah’s presence. He put them on the fat and the right thigh.
He placed all these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons. Moses presented all these things to Jehovah as an offering.
Then he took them from their hands and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar. These were ordination offerings, offerings by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
Moses also took the breast from the ram of the ordination offering and presented it to Jehovah. It was Moses' share, as Jehovah commanded.
Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar. He sprinkled it on Aaron and his clothes and on his sons and their clothes. In this way he dedicated Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes.
Moses told Aaron and his sons: "Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Take the meat and the bread in the basket of the ordination offering. Eat them there as I commanded when I said: ‘ Aaron and his sons will eat it. ’
"You must burn all meat or bread that is left over.
"You will not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days. Do not leave until the last day of your ordination is over. It will take seven days to ordain you.
"I did today what Jehovah commanded me to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for you.
"You will stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and keep the watch as Jehovah directs you. Then you will not die. This is what I was commanded."
So Aaron and his sons did everything Jehovah commanded through Moses.
On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
He told Aaron: "Take a calf that has no defects for an offering for sin and a ram that has no defects as a burnt offering. Sacrifice them in Jehovah’s presence.
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ Take a male goat as an offering for sin, a calf and a lamb, each one-year-old and without defects, as a burnt offering,
a bull and a ram as a fellowship offering, and a grain offering mixed with olive oil to sacrifice in Jehovah’s presence. Jehovah will appear to you today. ’"
They took the things Moses commanded and brought them in front of the Tent of Meeting. The entire congregation stood in Jehovah’s presence.
Moses said: "Jehovah commanded you to offer these sacrifices so that you may see Jehovah’s glory."
Moses told Aaron: "Come to the altar and sacrifice an offering for sin and a burnt offering to pay compensation for your sins and the sins of the people and make peace with Jehovah. Then make an offering for the people that they may pay compensation for their wrongdoing and to make peace with Jehovah just as Jehovah has commanded."
Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as his own offering for sin.
Aaron's sons brought him the blood. He dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar. After that he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.
On the altar he burned the fat, kidneys, and lobe of the liver from the offering for sin as Jehovah commanded Moses.
He burned the meat and the skin outside the camp.
He slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering. Aaron's sons gave him the blood. He threw it against the altar on all sides.
They also gave him the burnt offering. It was cut in pieces and included the head. He burned it on the altar.
He washed the internal organs and the legs and laid them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
He brought the people's offerings. He took the male goat for the people's offering for sin and slaughtered it. Then he sacrificed it to take away sins as he had done before.
He followed the proper procedures and brought forward the burnt offering and sacrificed it.
He also brought the grain offering. He took a handful of grain and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering.
He slaughtered the bull and the ram for the people's fellowship offering. Aaron's sons gave him the blood. He threw it against the altar on all sides.
The fat from the bull and the ram, the fat from the tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver
they placed on the breasts. Aaron burned them all on the altar.
First he took the breasts and the right thighs and presented them to Jehovah just as Moses commanded.
Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them. He sacrificed the offering for sin, the burnt offering, and the fellowship offering. Then he came down from the altar.
Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. As soon as they came out, they blessed the people. Then Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the people.
Fire came out from Jehovah’s presence and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar. As soon as all the people saw this, they shouted and bowed with their faces touching the ground.
Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took an incense burner. They put burning coals and incense in it. Then in Jehovah’s presence they offered this unauthorized fire.
A fire flashed from Jehovah and burned them. They died in the presence of Jehovah.
Moses said to Aaron: "This is what Jehovah was speaking about when he said: ‘ All who serve me must respect my holiness. I will reveal my glory to my people. ’" But Aaron remained silent.
Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle. He said: "Come here and carry your cousins' bodies away from the sacred tent and put them outside the camp."
So they came and took hold of the clothing on the corpses. They carried them outside the camp just as Moses had commanded.
Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar: Do not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes to show that you are in mourning. If you do you will die. For Jehovah will be angry with the whole community. But all other Israelites are allowed to mourn this death caused by the fire Jehovah sent.
"You are Jehovah’s chosen priests. You must not leave the sacred tent, or you will die." Aaron and his two sons obeyed Moses.
Jehovah said to Aaron:
"Never drink beer or wine when you or your sons enter the sacred tent. If you do, you will die right there! This is a long lasting law from generation to generation.
"You must learn the difference distinction between what is holy and what is not holy and between the clean and the unclean.
"You must also teach the people of Israel everything that I commanded Moses to say to them."
Moses spoke to Aaron and his two remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar. He said: "Take the grain offering that is left over from the food offered to Jehovah. Bake unleavened bread with it and eat it beside the altar. This is because this offering is very holy.
"Eat it in a holy place. It is the part that belongs to you and your sons from the food offered to Jehovah. That is what Jehovah commanded me.
"You and your families may eat the breast and the hind leg that are presented as the special gift and the special contribution to Jehovah for the priests. You may eat them in any ritually clean place. These offerings have been given to you and your children as the part that belongs to you from the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel.
"They shall bring the hind leg and the breast at the time the fat is presented as a food offering to Jehovah. These parts belong to you and your children from generation to generation, just as Jehovah commanded."
Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering and learned that it had already been burned. This made him angry with Eleazar and Ithamar. He demanded:
"Why did you not eat the sin offering in a sacred place? It is very holy! Jehovah gave it to you in order to take away the sin of the community.
"Since its blood was not brought into the sacred Tent, you should have eaten the sacrifice there, as I commanded."
Aaron answered: "If I had eaten the sin offering today, would Jehovah have approved? The people presented their sin offering to Jehovah today. They brought their burnt offering, but still these terrible things have happened to me."
When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ Here are the kinds of land animals you may eat:
"‘ You may eat all animals that have completely divided hoofs and that also chew their cud.
"‘ You must not eat those that either chew their cud or have divided hoofs. These are the kinds you must never eat: You must never eat camels. Camels are unclean because they chew their cud but do not have divided hoofs.
"‘ Never eat pigs. Pigs have completely divided hoofs but do not chew their cud. They are also unclean.
"‘ Never eat the meat of these animals or touch their dead bodies. They are unclean for you.
"‘ Here are the kinds of creatures that live in the water that you may eat. You may eat anything in the seas and streams that have fins and scales.
"‘ On the other hand, you must consider all swarming creatures living in the seas or the streams that have no fins or scales disgusting.
"‘ They must remain disgusting to you. Never eat their meat. Consider their dead bodies repulsive.
"‘ Every creature in the water without fins or scales is offensive to you.
"‘ Here are the kinds of birds you must consider disgusting and must not eat. They are eagles, bearded vultures, black vultures,
"‘ Every swarming, winged insect that walks across the ground like a four-legged animal is disgusting to you.
"‘ However, you may eat winged insects that swarm if they use their legs to hop on the ground.
"‘ You may eat any kind of locust, cricket, katydid, or grasshopper.
"‘ Every kind of winged insect that walks across the ground like a four-legged animal is disgusting to you.
"‘ Regarding the creatures mentioned above, this is how you would become unclean: When you touch their dead bodies you will be unclean until evening.
"‘ The following swarming creatures that move on the ground are unclean for you: the weasels, mole rats, mice, and all types of lizards,
"‘ Of all the swarming creatures that move on the ground, these are unclean for you. He who touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening.
"‘ When the dead body of one of these creatures falls on something, that thing will be unclean. It may be a wooden article, clothing, leather, a sack, or anything used for any purpose. It should be put in water and will be unclean until evening. It will then be clean again.
"‘ If any of these creatures falls into a piece of pottery, break the pottery because everything in it is unclean.
"‘ If water from that pottery touches any food, the food is unclean. Any liquid that you drink from that pottery is unclean.
"‘ Anything on which their dead bodies fall is unclean. If it is an oven or a stove, smash it. It is unclean and will remain unclean for you.
"‘ A spring or a cistern holding water will remain clean. But anyone who touches their dead bodies will be unclean.
"‘ If their dead bodies fall on seed that is to be planted, the seed is clean.
"‘ If water is poured on the seed and their dead bodies fall on it, the seed is unclean for you.
"‘ When any animal that you are allowed to eat dies, whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Those who eat any of its dead body must wash their clothes. They will be unclean until evening. Those who carry its dead body away will wash their clothes and will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Any creature that swarms on the ground is disgusting and must not be eaten.
"‘ Do not eat any creature with many legs that goes on its belly or on the ground like a four-legged animal, or any creature that swarms on the ground. Consider them disgusting.
"‘ Do not become disgusting by eating anything that swarms on the ground. Do not allow yourselves to become unclean because of them.
"‘ The reason is because I am Jehovah your God. You must live holy lives. Consecrate yourselves and be holy because I am holy. Never become unclean by touching anything that swarms or crawls on the ground.
"‘ I am Jehovah! I brought you out of Egypt to be your God. Be holy because I am holy.
"‘ This is the law about animals, birds, and every living creature that swims in the water and every creature that swarms on the ground.
"‘ This law helps you distinguish between clean and unclean, the animals you may eat and those you may not eat. ’"
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ When a woman gives birth to a boy, she will be unclean for seven days. This is the same number of days she is unclean for her monthly period.
"‘ The boy must be circumcised when he is eight days old.
"‘ She must stay at home for thirty-three days in order to be made clean from her bleeding. She must not touch anything holy or go into the holy place until the days needed to make her clean are over.
"‘ When a woman gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean as in her monthly period. She will be unclean for two weeks. Then she must stay at home for sixty-six days in order to be made clean from her bleeding.
"‘ When the days needed to make her clean are over, she must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a mourning dove as an offering for sin. She should bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
"‘ The priest will offer them in Jehovah’s presence to pay compensation for sin and make peace with Jehovah for her. Then she will be clean from her flow of blood. These are the instructions for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl.
"‘ If she cannot afford a lamb, she must use two mourning doves or two pigeons. One will be the burnt offering and the other the offering for sin. So the priest will pay compensation for sin and make peace with Jehovah for her and she will be clean. ’"
Jehovah gave Moses and Aaron these regulations:
"If any of you have a sore on your skin or a boil or an inflammation that could develop into a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the priest.
"The priest will examine the sore. If the hairs in it have turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest will pronounce you unclean.
"If the sore is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin around it and the hairs have not turned white, the priest will isolate you for seven days.
"The priest will examine you again on the seventh day. If in his opinion the sore looks the same and has not spread, he will isolate you for another seven days.
"The priest will examine you again on the seventh day. If the sore has faded and has not spread, he will pronounce you ritually clean. It is only a sore. You will wash your clothes and be ritually clean.
"If the sore spreads after the priest has examined you and pronounced you clean, you must return to the priest again.
"The priest will examine you again. If it has spread, he will pronounce you unclean. It is a dreaded skin disease.
"If any of you have a dreaded skin disease, you should be brought to the priest.
"He will examine you. If there is a white sore on your skin that turns the hairs white and is full of pus,
it is a chronic skin disease. The priest will pronounce you unclean. There is no need to isolate you. You are obviously unclean.
"If the skin disease spreads and covers you from head to foot,
the priest should examine you again. If he finds that it actually has covered the whole body, he will pronounce you ritually clean. If your whole skin has turned white you are ritually clean.
"The moment an open sore appears you are unclean.
"The priest will examine you again. If he sees an open sore, he will pronounce you unclean. An open sore means a dreaded skin disease. You are unclean.
"When the sore heals and becomes white again, you should go to the priest.
"He will examine you again. If the sore has turned white you are ritually clean. The priest will pronounce you clean.
"If you have a boil that has healed
and if afterward a white swelling or a reddish-white spot appears where the boil was, you should go to the priest.
"The priest will examine you. If the spot seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it have turned white, he will pronounce you unclean. It is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the boil.
"If the priest examines it and finds that the hairs in it have not turned white and that it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest will isolate you for seven days.
"If the spot spreads the priest shall pronounce you unclean. You are diseased.
"If it remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar left from the boil. The priest will pronounce you ritually clean.
"In case any of you have been burned. If the raw flesh becomes white or reddish-white,
the priest will examine it. If the hair on the affected area has turned white and the affected area looks deeper than the rest of the skin, an infectious skin disease has developed in the burn. The priest will pronounce you unclean. It is an infectious skin disease.
"But if the priest examines it and the hair in it is not white and the affected area is not deeper than the rest of the skin but has faded, the priest must put you in isolation for seven days.
"The priest will examine you again on the seventh day. If it is spreading it is a dreaded skin disease. The priest will pronounce you unclean.
"If the spot remains unchanged and does not spread and is light in color, it is not a dreaded skin disease. The priest will pronounce you ritually clean, because it is only a scar from the burn.
"When any of you, male or female, have a sore on your head or chin,
the priest will examine it. If it seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it are yellowish and thin, it is a dreaded skin disease. He will declare you unclean.
"If the priest examines you and finds the sore does not appear to be deeper than the surrounding skin, but there are still no healthy hairs in it, he will isolate you for seven days.
"The priest will examine the sore again on the seventh day. If it has not spread and there are no yellowish hairs in it and it does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin,
you will shave the head accept the area around the sore. The priest will isolate you for another seven days.
"The priest will again examine the sore on the seventh day. If it has not spread and does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin, he will declare you ritually clean. You will wash your clothes. You will be clean.
"If the sore spreads after you have been pronounced clean,
the priest will examine you again. If the sore has spread, he need not look for yellowish hairs. You are obviously unclean.
"If in the priest's opinion the sore has not spread and healthy hairs are growing in it, the sore has healed. The priest will pronounce you ritually clean.
"When you, male or female, have white spots on the skin,
the priest shall examine you. If the spots are dull white, it is only a blemish that has broken out on the skin. You are ritually clean.
"Loss of hair makes one bald not unclean.
"If a reddish-white sore appears on the bald spot, it is a dreaded skin disease.
"The priest will examine you. If there is a reddish-white sore,
the priest will declare you unclean. You have a dreaded skin disease on your head.
"If you have a dreaded skin disease, you must wear torn clothes, leave your hair uncombed, cover the lower part of your face, and call out: Unclean, unclean!
"You remain unclean as long as you have the disease. You must live outside the camp, away from others.
"When there is mildew on clothing, whether wool or linen,
if it is greenish or reddish, it is a spreading mildew and must be shown to the priest.
"The priest shall examine it and put the object away for seven days.
"He will examine it again on the seventh day. If the mildew has spread, the object is unclean.
"The priest will burn it, because it is a spreading mildew. It must be destroyed by fire.
"If the priest finds that the mildew has not spread on the object,
he will order that it be washed and put away for another seven days.
"He shall examine it again and if the mildew has not changed color, even though it has not spread, it is still unclean. You must burn the object, whether the rot is on the front or the back.
"When the priest examines it again, the mildew has faded; he will tear it out of the clothing or leather.
"Then if the mildew reappears, it is spreading again, and the owner must burn the object.
"If he washes the object and the spot disappears, he should wash it again. It will be ritually clean."
This is the law about mildew on clothing. Whether it is wool or linen, or on linen or wool cloth or on anything made of leather; this is how the decision is made as to whether it is ritually clean or unclean.
Jehovah gave Moses
the following regulations about the ritual purification of those of you cured of a dreaded skin disease: "On the day you are to be pronounced clean, you should be brought to the priest.
"The priest will take you outside the camp and examine you. If the disease is healed,
the priest will order that two ritually clean birds be brought, along with a piece of cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop.
"The priest will order that one of the birds be killed over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water.
"He will take the other bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the red cord, and the hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was killed.
"He will sprinkle the blood seven times on the one of you who is to be purified from your skin disease. He will then pronounce you clean. He will let the live bird fly away over the open fields.
"You must wash your clothes, shave off all your hair, and take a bath. You will then be ritually clean. You may enter the camp. You must live outside your tent for seven days.
"On the seventh day you should again shave your head, your beard, your eyebrows, and all the rest of the hair on your body. You should wash your clothes and take a bath. Then you will be ritually clean.
"The eighth day bring two male lambs and one female lamb a year old that are without any defects. Also bring five pounds of flour mixed with olive oil, and half a pint of olive oil.
"The priest will take you and these offerings to the entrance of the Tent of Jehovah’s presence.
"Then the priest will take one of the male lambs and together with the half pint of oil he will offer it as a repayment offering. He will present them as a special gift to Jehovah for the priest.
"He will slaughter the lamb in the holy place where the animals for the sin offerings and the burnt offerings are slaughtered. He must do this because the repayment offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest and is very holy.
"The priest will take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the right ear lobe, on the right thumb, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed.
"The priest will also take some of the olive oil and pour it into his own left hand.
"He will dip his right finger in the oil in his left hand, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times in Jehovah’s presence.
"The priest will put some of the oil that is still in his hand on the right ear lobe, on the right thumb, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed. These are the same places he had put the blood of the guilt offering.
"The priest will put the rest of the oil in his hand on the head of the one to be cleansed. So he will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for that person in Jehovah’s presence.
"The priest will also sacrifice the offering for sin to make peace with Jehovah for the one who is being cleansed from his impurity. After that, he will slaughter the burnt offering.
"He will sacrifice the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. So the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for that person. The person who had the skin disease will be clean.
"If the one to be cleansed is poor and cannot afford that much, he must take one male lamb, present it to pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for himself, and use it for his guilt offering. He will take only eight cups of flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering, a quart of olive oil,
and two mourning doves or two pigeons, whatever he can afford. The one will be an offering for sin and the other a burnt offering.
"The eighth day he will take them to the priest for his cleansing at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in Jehovah’s presence.
"The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the quart of olive oil and present them to Jehovah.
"He will slaughter the lamb as a guilt offering. The priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right ear lobe, on the right thumb, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed.
"The priest will pour some of the olive oil into his own left hand.
"In Jehovah’s presence he will sprinkle some of the oil with his right finger seven times.
"The priest will put some of the oil that is in his hand on the right ear lobe, on the right thumb, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed. These are the same places he had put the blood of the guilt offering.
"In Jehovah’s presence, the priest will pour the rest of the oil in his hand on the head of the one to be cleansed in order to make a payment for him.
"The one to be cleansed must take one of the mourning doves or pigeons, the one he can afford,
and sacrifice it as an offering for sin. He will take the other and sacrifice it as a burnt offering together with the grain offering. So in Jehovah’s presence the priest will pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the one who is being cleansed.
"These are the instructions for one who has an infectious skin disease but cannot afford what is needed for his cleansing."
Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron:
"When you come to Canaan that I am going to give to you, mildew may appear in a house.
"Before the priest examines the house, he will order everything taken out of it so that nothing in the house will become unclean. Then the priest will go inside to examine the house.
"He will examine the mildew area on the walls. If it is green and red in sunken areas that are deeper than the rest of the wall,
the priest will go out to the door of the house and close up the house for seven days.
"The priest will go back and examine it again on the seventh day. If the mildew in the walls of the house has spread,
he must order the stones that have the mildew to be torn out and thrown outside the city in an unclean place.
"He must have the entire inside of the house scraped. The plaster dust scraped off the walls must be dumped in an unclean place outside the city.
"The stones must be replaced, and the house must be plastered again.
"If the mildew breaks out again in the house after the stones have been removed and the house has been scraped and plastered,
the priest will go and look. If it has spread, the house is unclean.
"It must be torn down, and its stones, its wood, and all its plaster must be carried out of the city to an unclean place.
"Whoever goes into the house during the time that he has quarantined it, becomes unclean until evening.
"Whoever lies down in the house must wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house must wash his clothes.
"If the mildew has not reappeared after the house has been replastered, the priest will pronounce the house ritually clean. This is because the mildew has been completely removed.
"He shall take two birds, some cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop to purify the house.
"He should kill one of the birds over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water.
"Then he will take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the red cord, and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water. He will sprinkle the house seven times.
"This is the way he will purify the house with the bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the red cord.
"Then the priest will let the living bird fly from the city into the open country. He will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the house. It will be clean."
These are the instructions for any kind of mildew or fungus
that infects clothing or houses
These instructions for skin diseases and mildew help you distinguish between what is clean and unclean.
Again Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ When a man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean.
"‘ He is unclean because of the discharge from his body. Whether it is chronic or not makes no difference. He is still unclean.
"‘ The man who has a discharge makes everything he lies on or sits on unclean.
"‘ Those who touch his bed must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Those who sit on anything he sat on must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Those who touch a man who has a discharge must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Should a man who has a discharge spit on anyone who is clean, the person he spits on must wash his clothes and his body. He will be unclean until evening.
"‘ When a man who has a discharge sits on a saddle, it becomes unclean.
"‘ Those who carry such things must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ If a man who has a discharge touches anyone without first rinsing his hands, the person he touched must wash his clothes and his body. He will be unclean until evening.
"‘ When a man who has a discharge touches pottery, it must be broken. When he touches a wooden bucket it must be rinsed.
"‘ When a man's discharge stops, he must wait seven days to be cleansed. He must wash his clothes and his body in fresh water. Then he will be clean.
"‘ He must take two mourning doves or two pigeons and come into Jehovah’s presence at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting on the eighth day. He will give these birds to the priest.
"‘ The priest will sacrifice one as an offering for sin and the other as a burnt offering. Thus in Jehovah’s presence, the priest will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the man who had a discharge.
"‘ If a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body. He will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Any clothes or any leather with semen on it must be washed. It will be unclean until evening.
"‘ When a man has sexual intercourse with a woman and has an emission of semen, they must wash themselves. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ When a woman has her monthly period, she will be unclean for seven days. Those who touch her will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Everything she lies on or sits on during her period will be unclean.
"‘ Those who touch her bed must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ If a man has sexual intercourse with her while she has her period, he will be unclean for seven days. Any bed he lies on will become unclean.
"‘ When a woman has a discharge of blood for many days other than her monthly period, she is unclean. If her period lasts longer than usual, she will be unclean as long as she has a discharge. It is similar to her period.
"‘ As long as she has a discharge, any bed she lies on or anything she sits on is unclean. It is similar to her period.
"‘ Those who touch these things are unclean and must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening.
"‘ When her discharge stops she must wait seven days. After that she will be clean.
"‘ She must take two mourning doves or two pigeons on the eighth day and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
"‘ The priest will offer one as an offering for sin and the other as a burnt offering. So in Jehovah’s presence the priest will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the woman who had an unclean discharge. ’"
"You must separate the Israelites from anything that keeps them from being presentable to me. Otherwise they will die. This is because they defile my tent, which is among them, and make it unclean."
These are the instructions for any man, who has a discharge or an emission of semen that makes him unclean,
for any woman who has her period, for any man or woman who has a discharge, or for any man who has sexual intercourse with a woman when she is unclean.
Jehovah spoke to Moses after Aaron's two sons came into Jehovah’s presence and died.
Jehovah said: "Tell your brother Aaron that he cannot go into the holy place whenever he wants to. If he goes up to the canopy and stands in front of the throne of mercy on the Ark, he will die. This is because I appear in the smoke above the throne of mercy.
"This is what Aaron must do in order to come into the holy place: He must take a bull as an offering for sin and a ram as a burnt offering.
"He must dress in a holy linen robe and wear linen undergarments. He must wear a linen belt and turban. These are holy clothes. He should wash his body and put them on.
"He will take two male goats from the congregation of Israel as an offering for sin and a ram as a burnt offering.
"Aaron must sacrifice the bull as his own offering for sin. By doing this, he will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for himself and his family.
"He must take the two male goats and bring them into Jehovah’s presence at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
"I will show Aaron which goat will be sacrificed to me and which one will be sent into the desert to the demon Azazel.
"After he offers the first goat as a sacrifice for sin,
the other one must be presented to me alive, before he sends it into the desert to take away the sins of the people.
"He must offer the bull as a sacrifice to ask forgiveness for your own sins and for the sins of your family.
"He will take an incense burner full of burning coals from the altar in Jehovah’s presence, and two handfuls of finely ground, sweet-smelling incense. He will bring them up to the canopy.
"He must place the incense on the fire in Jehovah’s presence. The cloud of incense will cover the throne of mercy. This is over the words of God's promise, so that he will not die.
"He will take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the throne of mercy. Then he will sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times in front of the throne of mercy.
"Aaron will slaughter the goat for the people's offering for sin. He will take the blood inside, go up to the canopy, and sprinkle it on the throne of mercy and in front of it, as he did with the bull's blood.
"He will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for all the sins the Israelites committed against the holy place. These sins happened because the Israelites were unclean and because they committed rebellious acts. He will do the same for the Tent of Meeting that is among an unclean people.
"No one may be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron enters the holy place to do this until he comes out. Aaron will pay compensation for wrongdoing and peace with Jehovah for his own sins, his family's sins, and the sins of the entire assembly of Israel.
"He will go out to the altar in Jehovah’s presence and pay compensation for the wrong and make peace with Jehovah for the sins committed. He will take some of the blood from the bull and some of the goat's blood and put it all around the horns of the altar.
"With his finger he will sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times. Because the Israelites made it unclean, he will cleanse it and declare it holy.
"When he finishes making peace with Jehovah at the holy place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he will bring the living goat forward.
"Aaron will place both hands on its head. He will confess over it all the sins, all the rebellious acts, and all the things the Israelites did wrong. He will transfer them to the goat's head. A man will be appointed to release the goat in the desert.
"The goat will take all their sins away to a deserted place. The man must release the goat in the desert.
"Aaron will go to the Tent of Meeting. He will take off the linen clothes he put on to go into the holy place, and leave them there.
"He will wash his body in the holy place and put on his other clothes. Then he will come out and sacrifice the burnt offering for himself and for the people to make peace with Jehovah for his own sins and the sins of the people.
"He will burn the fat of the offering for sin on the altar.
"The man who released the goat to Azazel must wash his clothes and his body. Then he may return to the camp.
"The bull and the goat used for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to take away sin, will be carried outside the camp and burned. Skin, meat, and intestines must all be burned.
"The one who burns them must wash his clothes and take a bath before he returns to camp.
"The following regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come. On the tenth day of the seventh month the Israelites and the foreigners living among them must fast and must not do any work.
"On that day the ritual is to be performed to purify them from all their sins, so that they will be ritually clean.
"That day is to be a very holy day, one on which they fast and do no work at all. These regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come.
"High Priest, properly ordained and consecrated to succeed his father, is to perform the ritual of purification. He must dress in priestly garments
and perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of Jehovah’s presence, the altar, the priests, and all the people of the community.
"These regulations are to be observed for a long lasting time to come. This ritual must be performed once a year to purify the people of Israel from all their sins." So Moses did as Jehovah commanded.
Jehovah commanded Moses:
"Give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations.
"Any Israelite who slaughters a bull, sheep, or goat inside or outside the camp
"This means that the people of Israel must take the sacrifices they have been making in the open fields and bring them to Jehovah. They must bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The people will sacrifice them as peace offerings to Jehovah.
"The priest will pour the blood against Jehovah’s altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. He will burn the fat as a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"The people must stop sacrificing to goat idols demons and chasing after them as though they were prostitutes. This is a long lasting law for the people and for future generations.
"Tell them: ‘ If Israelites or foreigners make burnt offerings or sacrifices,
but do not bring them to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to offer them to Jehovah. They must be excluded from the people.
"‘ If Israelites or foreigners eat any blood, I will condemn them and exclude them from the people.
"‘ This is because life of every living thing is in the blood. I have given this blood to you to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with me on the altar. Blood is needed to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with me. ’"
"That is why I have said to the people of Israel: ‘ Neither you nor foreigners should ever eat blood. ’"
"If Israelites or foreigners hunt any animal or bird that may be eaten, they must pour out the animal's blood and cover it with dirt.
"This is because the life of any creature is in its blood. So I have said to the people of Israel: ‘ Never eat any blood, because the life of any creature is in its blood. Whoever eats blood must be excluded from the people. ’"
"Native Israelites or foreigners who eat the body of an animal that dies naturally or is killed by another animal must wash their clothes and their bodies. They will be unclean until evening. Then they will be clean.
"If they do not wash their clothes and their bodies, they will be guilty of sin."
Jehovah told Moses:
"Speak to the people of Israel and say: ‘ I am Jehovah your God!
"‘ Do not follow the customs of Egypt where you used to live or those of Canaan where I am bringing you.
"‘ I am Jehovah your God! You must obey my teachings.
"‘ Obey them and you will live. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Do not have sex with any of your close relatives,
especially your own mother. This would disgrace your father.
"‘ Do not disgrace him by having sex with any of his other wives.
"‘ Never have sexual intercourse with your stepsister, whether she is your father's daughter or your mother's daughter. It makes no difference whether or not she was born in your house.
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with your granddaughter, whether she is your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, because she is related to you.
"‘ Never have sexual intercourse with a daughter of your father and his wife. She is your own sister.
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with your father's sister. She is your paternal aunt.
"‘ Never have sexual intercourse with the wife of your father's brother. She, too, is your aunt.
"‘ Never have sexual intercourse with your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife. Never have sexual intercourse with her.
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with your sister-in-law. She is your brother's wife.
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with a woman and her daughter or a woman and her granddaughter. They are related. Doing this is perverted.
"‘ While your wife is living, never marry her sister as a rival wife and have sexual intercourse with her.
"‘ Never have sexual intercourse with a woman while she is unclean during her monthly period.
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with your neighbor's wife and become unclean with her.
"‘ Never give your children as sacrifices to the god Molech by burning them alive. If you do, you are dishonoring the name of your God. I am Jehovah!
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with a man as with a woman. It is disgusting.
"‘ Do not have sexual intercourse with any animal and become unclean with it. A woman must never offer herself to an animal for sexual intercourse. It is unnatural.
"‘ Do not become unclean in any of these ways. By these practices all the nations that I am forcing out of your way have become unclean.
"‘ The land has become unclean. I will punish it for its sins. The land will vomit out those who live in it.
"‘ Live by my standards, and obey my rules. Neither you nor any foreigner should ever do any of these disgusting things.
"‘ If you make the land unclean, it will vomit you out as it has vomited out the people who were there before you.
"‘ Whoever does any of these disgusting things must be excluded from the people.
"‘ Therefore you must follow my instructions. Do not live by the standards of the people who lived there before you. What they do is disgusting. Never become unclean that way. I am Jehovah your God! ’"
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Tell the entire congregation of Israel: ‘ Be holy because I, Jehovah your God, am holy.
"‘ Respect your mother and father. Observe my days of worship. I am Jehovah your God!
"‘ Do not turn to worthless gods or cast metal idols. Never make any gods for yourselves. I am Jehovah your God.
"‘ When you bring a peace offering to Jehovah, sacrifice it properly so that you will be accepted.
"‘ Eat your sacrifice on the day you bring it and on the next day. On the third day burn whatever is left over.
"‘ If you eat any of it on the third day, it is repulsive and will not be accepted.
"‘ Those who eat it will be punished because they have dishonored what is holy to Jehovah. They must be excluded from the people.
"‘ When you reap the harvest of your land, you should not reap to the very corners of your field. You should not gather the gleanings of your harvest.
"‘ Do not glean your vineyard. Do not gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard. Leave them for the needy and for the stranger. I am Jehovah your God.
"‘ Do not steal. Do not deal falsely. Do not lie to one another.
"‘ Do not swear falsely by my name, so as to profane the name of your God. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Do not oppress your neighbor and do not rob him. Do not fail to pay your workers at the end of each day.
"‘ Do not curse a deaf man. Do not place a stumbling block before the blind. You must deeply respect your God. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Do no injustice in judgment. Do not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great. Judge your neighbor fairly.
"‘ Never gossip. Never endanger your neighbor's life. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Never hate your brother in your heart. Be sure to correct your neighbor so that you will not be guilty of sinning along with him.
"‘ Do not seek revenge. Never hold a grudge against any of your people. Instead, love your neighbor as you love yourself. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Obey my laws. Never crossbreed different kinds of animals. Do not plant two kinds of crops in your field. Never wear clothes made from two kinds of material.
"‘ If a man has sexual intercourse with a female slave who is engaged to another man and if her freedom was never bought or given to her, they should not be put to death. He will only pay a fine because she is a slave.
"‘ He must bring a ram for his guilt offering to Jehovah at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
"‘ In Jehovah’s presence the priest will use them to pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for this sin. The man will be forgiven for this sin.
"‘ When you come into the land and plant all kinds of fruit trees, you must not eat the fruit for the first three years.
"‘ All the fruit will be a holy offering of praise to Jehovah in the fourth year.
"‘ You may eat the fruit in the fifth year. Do this to make the trees produce more for you. I am Jehovah your God.
"‘ Do not eat any meat with blood still in it. Never cast evil spells, and never consult fortunetellers.
"‘ Do not shave the hair on your foreheads. Do not cut the edges of your beard.
"‘ Never slash your body to mourn the dead, and never get a tattoo. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Do not dishonor your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the country will turn to prostitution and be filled with people who are perverted.
"‘ Observe my days of worship and respect my holy tent. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Do not turn to psychics or mediums to get help. That will make you unclean. I am Jehovah your God.
"‘ Show respect to the elderly, and honor older people. In this way you show respect for your God. I am Jehovah.
"‘ Never mistreat a foreigner living in your land.
"‘ Foreigners living among you will be like your own people. Love them as you love yourself, because you were foreigners living in Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.
"‘ Do not be corrupt when administering justice concerning length, weight, or measuring liquid.
"‘ Use honest scales, honest weights, and honest measures. I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of Egypt.
"‘ Obey all my laws and all my rules, and live by them. I am Jehovah! ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ If Israelites or foreigners living among you give one of their children as a sacrifice to the god Molech, they must be put to death. The common people must stone them to death.
"‘ I will condemn them and exclude them from the people. They gave one of their children to Molech. They made my holy tent unclean, and dishonored my holy name.
"‘ If the people of the land ignore those who give their children to Molech and do not put them to death,
"‘ I will condemn them and their families. I will exclude them from the people. I will exclude from the people everyone who chases after Molech as if he were a prostitute.
"‘ If any of you go for advice to people who consult the spirits of the dead, I will turn against you and will no longer consider you one of my people.
"‘ Keep consecrate yourselves holy, because I am Jehovah your God!
"‘ Obey my laws, because I am Jehovah and I make you holy.
"‘ Jehovah gave the following regulations. Any of you that curse your father or mother shall be put to death. You are responsible for your own death.
"‘ If a man commits adultery with the wife of an Israelite, both he and the woman should be put to death.
"‘ A man who has intercourse with one of his father's wives disgraces his father. Both he and the woman must be put to death. They are responsible for their own death.
"‘ If a man has sexual intercourse with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death. They have done a disgusting thing and deserve to die.
"‘ When a man has sexual intercourse with another man as with a woman, both men are doing something disgusting and must be put to death. They deserve to die!
"‘ When a man marries a woman and her mother, they have done a perverted thing. The man and the two women must be burned. Never do this perverted thing.
"‘ If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he and the animal must be put to death.
"‘ If a woman tries to have sexual relations with an animal, she and the animal must be put to death. They are responsible for their own death.
"‘ If a man marries his sister or half sister, they must be publicly disgraced and driven out of the community. He has had intercourse with his sister and must suffer the consequences.
"‘ If a man has intercourse with a woman during her monthly period, both of them are to be driven out of the community, because they have broken the regulations about ritual uncleanness.
"‘ When a man has intercourse with his aunt, both of them must suffer the consequences for incest.
"‘ Whoever has sexual intercourse with his uncle's wife violates his uncle's marriage. That man and woman are guilty of sin. They will die without children.
"‘ He who marries his brother's wife violates his brother's marriage and does an unclean thing. That man and woman will have no children.
"‘ If you carefully obey all my laws and my rules, the land I am bringing you to live in will not vomit you out.
"‘ The nations I am chasing out did these disgusting things. I hated them for it! So do not follow their example.
"‘ I am Jehovah your God. I have promised you their land that is rich with milk and honey. I have chosen you to be different from other people.
"‘ That is why you must make a difference between animals and birds that I have said are clean and unclean. This will keep you from becoming disgusting to me.
"‘ I am Jehovah, the Holy God. You have been chosen to be my people, and so you must be holy too.
"‘ If you claim to receive messages from the dead, you will be put to death by stoning, just as you deserve.
Jehovah gave Moses these instructions for Aaron's sons, the priests: "Touching a dead body will make you unclean. So do not go near a dead relative,
except for your mother, father, son, daughter, brother,
or an unmarried sister, who has no husband to take care of her.
"As the head of your people, you should never become unclean. That would make you unholy.
"You should never mourn by shaving bald spots on your heads, shaving the edges of your beards, or slashing your bodies.
"Be God's holy men. Do not dishonor the name of your God. Be holy because you bring sacrifices by fire to Jehovah. It is the food bread of your God.
"Never marry prostitutes, those who have lost their virginity, or divorced women because a priest is God's holy man.
"Be holy because you offer the food of your God. Be holy because I, Jehovah, am holy. I set you apart as holy.
"When a priest's daughter dishonors herself by becoming a prostitute, she dishonors her father. She must be burned.
"The priest who is anointed with oil and wears the chief priest's clothes is chief over his brothers. He must never mourn by leaving his hair uncombed or by tearing his clothes.
"He must not go near any dead bodies or become unclean, even for his father or mother.
"The anointed priest should marry a virgin.
"He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, a woman who has lost her virginity, or a prostitute. He may only marry a virgin from his own people.
"He must not dishonor his children among his people because I, Jehovah, set him apart as holy."
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Tell Aaron: ‘ If any of your descendants, now or in future generations, has a physical defect, he must never bring food to offer to God.
"‘ No one who has a physical defect may ever come near the altar. That means anyone who is blind or lame, who has a disfigured face, a deformity,
or a crippled hand or foot,
who is a hunchback or dwarf, who has defective sight, skin diseases, or crushed testicles.
"‘ If a descendant of the priest Aaron has a physical defect, he must never bring sacrifices by fire to Jehovah. He has a defect. He must never bring food to offer to God.
"‘ He may eat the food of his God, what is holy and what is very holy.
"‘ However, he must never come up to the canopy or to the altar, since he has a physical defect. He must never dishonor the holy places because I, Jehovah, set them apart as holy. ’"
Thus Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Tell Aaron and his sons that they must respect the holy offerings that the Israelites set apart for me. In this way they will not dishonor my holy name. I am Jehovah."
"Tell them: ‘ In future generations if any of your descendants, while unclean, comes near the holy offerings the Israelites set apart for Jehovah, that person must be excluded from my presence. I am Jehovah.
"‘ None of the descendants of Aaron who has a dreaded skin disease or a discharge may eat any of the sacred offerings until he is ritually clean. Any priest is unclean if he touches anything that is unclean through contact with a corpse or if he has an emission of semen
or if he has touched an unclean animal or person.
"‘ Any priest who becomes unclean remains unclean until evening. Even then he may not eat any of the sacred offerings until he has taken a bath.
"‘ After the sunsets he is clean. Then he may eat the sacred offerings, which are his food.
"‘ He must not eat the meat of any animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals. It will make him unclean. I am Jehovah.
"‘ All priests must observe the regulations that I have given. Otherwise, they will become guilty and die, because they have disobeyed the sacred regulations. I am Jehovah and I make them holy.
"‘ Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of the sacred offerings. No one else may eat them, not even someone staying with a priest or hired by him.
"‘ A priest's slaves, bought with his own money or born in his home, may eat the food the priest receives.
"‘ A priest's daughter who marries someone who is not a priest may not eat any of the sacred offerings.
"‘ A widowed or divorced daughter who has no children and who has returned to live in her father's house as a dependent may eat the food her father receives as a priest. Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of it.
"‘ If any people who are not members of a priestly family eat any of the sacred offerings without intending to, they must repay the priest its full value plus an additional twenty percent.
"‘ The priests must not profane the sacred offerings
by letting any unauthorized people eat them. This would bring guilt and punishment on such people. I am Jehovah and I make the offerings holy. ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, and tell them: ‘ Israelites or foreigners may bring burnt offerings to Jehovah for anything they vowed or as freewill offerings.
"‘ The offering must be a male that has no defects from your cattle, sheep, or goats in order to be accepted.
"‘ Do not bring any animal with a physical defect. This is because it will not be acceptable for you.
"‘ A person may bring Jehovah a peace offering to fulfill a vow or for a freewill offering. Whether it is from the cattle, sheep, or goats, it must be an animal that has no defects in order to be acceptable. It must never be an animal that has defects.
"‘ Do not bring Jehovah an animal that is blind, has broken bones, cuts, warts, scabs, or ringworm. Never give Jehovah any of these in a sacrifice by fire on the altar.
"‘ You may use a bull or a sheep with a deformity or one that is stunted in growth as a freewill offering. However, it will not be accepted for a vow.
"‘ Do not bring Jehovah an animal that has bruised, crushed, torn out, or cut out testicles. Never do any of these things to an animal in your land.
"‘ Never bring any kind of castrated animal received from a foreigner as a food offering for your God. A castrated animal will not be accepted on your behalf because castration is a physical defect. ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses.
"Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young the same day.
"When you sacrifice a thanksgiving offering to Jehovah do it in the proper way.
"Eat it the same day. Never leave any of it until morning. I am Jehovah.
"Carefully obey my commandments. Conform your life to them. I am Jehovah.
"Never dishonor my holy name. I will show my holiness among the Israelites. I am Jehovah, who sets you apart as holy.
"I brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am Jehovah!
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ These are the appointed festivals with Jehovah. You must announce these as holy assemblies.
"‘ You may work for six days. But the seventh day is a day of worship Sabbath, a day when you do not work, and a holy assembly. Do not do any work. It is Jehovah’s day of worship wherever you live.
"‘ The following are Jehovah’s appointed festivals with holy assemblies. You must announce these at their appointed times.
"‘ The Passover, celebrated to honor Jehovah, begins at sunset on the fourteenth day of the first month.
"‘ The fifteenth day of the same month the Festival of Unleavened Bread begins. You must not eat any bread made with yeast for seven days.
"‘ Gather to worship on the first of these days. Do none of your daily work.
"‘ Bring a sacrifice to Jehovah for seven days. On the seventh day there will be a holy assembly. Do not do any regular work. ’"
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"‘ He will present it to Jehovah so that you will be accepted. He will present it on the day after Passover.
"‘ On the day you present the bundle, you must sacrifice a one-year-old male lamb that has no defects as a burnt offering to Jehovah.
"‘ Present a grain offering of four quarts of flour mixed with olive oil with it. This will be a sacrifice by fire made to Jehovah. It will be a soothing aroma. Use one quart of wine for the wine offering.
"‘ Do not eat bread, roasted grain, or fresh grain until this same day. Then bring the offering to your God. It is a long lasting law for generations to come wherever you live.
"‘ Count seven full weeks from the day after Passover, the day you bring the bundle of grain as an offering presented to Jehovah
until the day after the seventh week. This is a total of fifty days. Then bring a new grain offering to Jehovah.
"‘ Bring two loaves of bread from your homes to present to Jehovah. Bake them with four quarts of flour. They are the first harvested grain for Jehovah.
"‘ Using the bread the community is to present seven one-year-old lambs, one bull, and two rams, none of which may have any defects. They should be offered as a burnt offering to Jehovah, along with a grain offering and a wine offering. The odor of this offering is pleasing to Jehovah.
"‘ Also offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering.
"‘ The priest should present the bread with the two lambs as a special gift to Jehovah for the priests. These offerings are holy.
"‘ Do none of your daily work. Gather for worship. Your descendants are to observe this regulation from generation to generation, no matter where they live.
"‘ When you harvest your fields, do not cut the grain at the edges of the fields. Do not go back to cut the heads of grain that were left. Leave them for poor people and foreigners. Jehovah is your God. ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Present a food offering to Jehovah. Do not do your daily work."
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"The tenth day of this seventh month is a special day for the payment for sins. There will be a holy assembly. Humble yourselves, and bring Jehovah a sacrifice by fire.
"Do not do any work that day. It is a special day for the payment for sins. It is a time when you pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah your God.
"Those who do not humble themselves on that day will be excluded from the people.
"I will destroy those who do any work on that day.
"Do not do any work! It is a long lasting law for generations to come wherever you live.
"It is a day of worship sabbath, a day when you do not work. Humble yourselves starting on the evening of the ninth day of the month. From that evening to the next, observe the day of worship."
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"‘ There will be a holy assemble on the first day. Do not do any regular work.
"‘ Bring a sacrifice by fire to Jehovah for seven consecutive days. On the eighth day there will be a holy assembly. Bring Jehovah a sacrifice by fire. This is the last festival of the year. Do not do any regular work.
"‘ These are Jehovah’s appointed festivals. Announce them as holy assemblies for bringing sacrifices by fire to Jehovah. Bring burnt offerings, grain offerings, other sacrifices, and wine offerings-each one on its special day.
"‘ This is in addition to Jehovah’s days of worship, your gifts, all your vows, and your freewill offerings to Jehovah.
"‘ Celebrate Jehovah’s festival for seven days. This should begin on the fifteenth day of the seventh month; at the time you gather what the land produces. The first and the eighth days will be worship festivals.
"‘ Take the best fruits, palm branches, the branches of leafy trees and poplars on the first day, and celebrate in the presence of Jehovah your God for seven days.
"‘ It is Jehovah’s festival. Celebrate it for seven days each year. This is a long lasting law for generations to come. Celebrate this festival in the seventh month.
"‘ Live in booths for seven days. Everyone born in Israel must live in booths.
"‘ This is how generations to come may learn how I made the people of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God! ’"
Moses told the Israelites about Jehovah’s appointed festivals.
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Command the Israelites to bring you pure, virgin olive oil for the lamp stand so that the lamps will not go out.
"Aaron must keep the lamps lit in the Tent of Meeting from evening until morning. This is outside the canopy where the words of my covenant are in Jehovah’s presence. It is a long lasting law for generations to come.
"Aaron must keep the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand lit in Jehovah’s presence.
"Take flour and bake twelve rings of bread. Each ring will contain four quarts of flour.
"Put them in two stacks of six each on the gold table in Jehovah’s presence.
"Place pure incense on top of each stack. The incense on the bread will be a reminder, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
"Every day of worship sabbath day a priest must arrange the bread in Jehovah’s presence. It is a long lasting reminder of my promise to the Israelites.
"The bread will belong to Aaron and his sons. They will eat it in a holy place. It is very holy, set apart from Jehovah’s offering by fire. This is a long lasting law."
A man, whose mother was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, from the tribe of Dan in Israel and whose father was from Egypt, got into a quarrel with an Israelite in the camp.
They held him in custody until Jehovah told them what to do.
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"The man who cursed my name must be taken outside the camp. All who heard him curse my name must lay their hands on his head. Then the whole congregation must stone him to death.
"Inform the Israelites: ‘ Those who treat their God with contempt will be punished for their sin.
"‘ However those who curse Jehovah’s name must be put to death. The whole congregation must stone them to death. It makes no difference whether they are Israelites or foreigners. Whoever curses abuses Jehovah’s name must die.
"‘ Whoever kills another person must be put to death.
"‘ Whoever kills an animal must replace it, life for life.
"‘ Should any of you injure another person, whatever you have done shall be done to you.
"‘ If you break a bone, one of your bones must be broken. If you put out an eye, one of your eyes must be put out. Should you knock out a tooth, one of your teeth shall be knocked out. Whatever injury you cause another person must be done to you in return.
"‘ Whoever kills an animal shall replace it, but whoever kills a human being shall be put to death.
"‘ This law applies to all of you. It applies to Israelites and to foreigners living among you. I am Jehovah your God. ’"
When Moses had said this to the people of Israel, they took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death. The people of Israel did what Jehovah commanded Moses.
Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and commanded:
"Give the following regulations to the people of Israel: ‘ When you enter the land that Jehovah is giving you, honor Jehovah by not cultivating the land every seventh year.
"‘ Plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and gather your crops for six years.
"‘ But the seventh year is to be a sabbath year of complete rest for the land. It is a year dedicated to Jehovah. Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards.
"‘ Do not even harvest the grain that grows by itself without being planted. Do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines. It is a year of complete rest for the land.
"‘ Even though the land has not been cultivated during that year, it will provide food for you, your slaves, your hired men, the foreigners living with you,
your domestic animals, and the wild animals in your fields. Everything that it produces may be eaten.
"‘ Count seven times seven years seven sabbaths of years, a total of forty-nine years.
"‘ Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement, send someone to blow a trumpet throughout the whole land.
"‘ In this way you will set the fiftieth year apart and proclaim freedom to all the inhabitants of the land. During this year all property that has been sold must be restored to the original owner or the descendants, and any who have been sold as slaves may return to their families.
"‘ That fiftieth year will be your jubilee year. Do not plant or harvest what grows by itself or pick grapes from the vines in the land.
"‘ The jubilee year will be holy to you. You will eat what the field itself produces.
"‘ In this jubilee year every slave will be freed in order to return to his property.
"‘ In the business of trading goods for money, do no wrong to one another.
"‘ Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops.
"‘ In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of crops he is selling to you.
"‘ You must not wrong one another. You shall respect your God. I am Jehovah your God.
"‘ You must observe my statutes and keep my judgments, so as to carry them out. That way you may live securely on the land.
"‘ The land will give you its products. You will eat all you want and live there securely.
"‘ "You may ask: "What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or bring in our crops?" ’"
"‘ I will give you my blessing in the sixth year so that the land will produce enough for three years.
"‘ You will plant again in the eighth year but live on what the land already produced. You will eat it, even in the ninth year, until the land produces more.
"‘ No land may be permanently bought or sold. It all belongs to me! It is not your land! You only live there for a little while.
"‘ When property is sold, the original owner must be given the first chance to buy it.
"‘ If any of you Israelites become so poor that you are forced to sell your property, your closest relative must buy it back.
"‘ If that relative has the money. Later, if you can afford to buy it,
you must pay enough to make up for what the present owner will lose on it before the next Year of Celebration, when the property would become yours again.
"‘ If he cannot earn enough to buy it back, what he sold stays in the hands of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it will be released, and he will own it again.
"‘ If anyone sells a home in a walled city, for one year after selling it he has the right to buy it back. He may buy it back only within that time.
"‘ If he does not buy it back during that year, the house in the city belongs to the buyer for generations to come. It will not be released in the jubilee.
"‘ Houses in villages without walls are regarded as belonging to the fields of the land. They can be bought back. They will be released in the jubilee.
"‘ The Levites always have the right to buy back their property in the cities they own.
"‘ If any Levite buys back a house, in the jubilee the purchased house in the city will be released. This is because the houses in the Levite cities are their property among the Israelites.
"‘ But a field that belongs to their cities must not be sold, because it is their property from generation to generation.
"‘ If an Israelite becomes poor and cannot support himself, you should help him. He must live with you as a stranger without a permanent home.
"‘ Do not collect interest or make any profit from him. Respect your God by respecting other Israelites' lives.
"‘ Do not collect any interest on your money or on the food you give them.
"‘ I am Jehovah your God. I brought you out of Egypt to give you Canaan and to be your God.
"‘ If an Israelite becomes poor and sells himself to you, do not work him like a slave.
"‘ He will be like a hired worker or a visitor to you. He may work with you until the year of jubilee.
"‘ Then you will release him and his children to go back to their family and the property of their ancestors.
"‘ They are my servants. I brought them out of Egypt. They must never be sold as slaves.
"‘ Do not treat them harshly. Respect your God.
"‘ You may have male and female slaves, but buy them from the nations around you.
"‘ You may also buy the children of the foreigners who are living among you. Such children born in your land may become your property.
"‘ You may leave them as an inheritance to your children, whom they must serve as long as they live. But you must not treat any Israelites harshly.
"‘ Suppose a foreigner living with you becomes rich, while some Israelites become poor and sell themselves as slaves to that foreigner or to a member of that foreigner's family.
"‘ He has the right to be set free by a relative, such as a brother.
"‘ His uncle, his cousin, or some other relative could also buy him back. If he becomes rich, he could buy his own freedom.
"‘ Then he and his buyer must take into account the number of years from the year he was bought until the year of jubilee. His sale price will be adjusted based on the number of years he was with his buyer. This is like the wages of a hired worker.
"‘ If there are many years left, he must refund from his purchase price an amount equal to those years.
"‘ He should serve his buyer as a hired worker during those years. His buyer should not treat him harshly.
"‘ If he cannot buy his freedom he and his children will be released in the year of jubilee.
"‘ The Israelites belong to me! They are my servants. I brought them out of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God! ’"
"‘ Do not make idols or set up statues, stone pillars, or carved stones to worship. I am Jehovah your God!
"‘ Keep the religious festivals and honor the place where I am worshiped. I am Jehovah.
"‘ If you live according to my laws and obey my commands,
"‘ I will send you rain at the proper time. Then the land will produce crops and the trees will bear fruit.
"‘ Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting grain when it is time to pick grapes. You will still be picking grapes when it is time to plant grain. You will have all you want to eat and you will live in safety in your land.
"‘ I will give you peace in your land. You can sleep without being afraid of anyone. I will get rid of the dangerous animals in the land. And there will be no more war there.
"‘ You will be victorious over your enemies.
"‘ Five of you will be able to defeat a hundred, and a hundred will be able to defeat ten thousand.
"‘ I will bless you and give you many children. I will keep my part of the covenant that I made with you.
"‘ Your harvests will be so plentiful that they will last for a year. Even after that you will have to throw away what is left of the old harvest to make room for the new!
"‘ I will live among you in my sacred tent, and I will never turn away from you.
"‘ So I will live among you and be your God, and you will be my people.
"‘ I am Jehovah your God. I brought you out of Egypt so that you are no longer slaves of the Egyptians. I have broken their power over you and made you live as a free people.
"‘ If you will not listen to me and obey all these commandments,
if you reject my laws and look at my rules with disgust, if you reject my promise by disobeying my commandments,
then this is what I will do to you: I will terrorize you with disease and fever. You will suffer from eye problems and depression. You will plant your crops and get nothing because your enemies will eat them.
"‘ I will condemn you so that you will go down in defeat in front of your enemies. Those who hate you will be your rulers. You will run away even when no one is chasing you.
"‘ If you still will not listen to me, I will discipline you seven times for your sins.
"‘ I will crush your arrogance. You will have no rain, and your land will be as hard as cement.
"‘ Your strength will be spent uselessly. Your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit.
"‘ If you act with hostility against me and are unwilling to obey me I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins.
"‘ I will send wild animals among you. They will rob you of your children. They will destroy your cattle, and make you so few that your roads will be deserted.
"‘ If this discipline does not help and you still resist,
"‘ I will resist you. I will punish you seven times for your sins.
"‘ I will bring war on you to get revenge for my promise you rejected. When you gather in your cities, I will send plagues on you and you will fall under the control of your enemy.
"‘ I will destroy your food supply. Ten women will need only one oven to prepare your food. You will eat and go away hungry.
"‘ If in spite of this you do not listen to me and still resist me,
"‘ I will resist you with great fury. I will discipline you seven times for your sins.
"‘ You will eat the bodies of your sons and daughters.
"‘ I will destroy your worship sites. I will cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on top of your dead idols. I will view you with disgust.
"‘ I will make your cities deserted and ruin your sacred places. I will no longer accept the soothing aroma from your sacrifices.
"‘ I will make your land so deserted that your enemies will be shocked as they settle in it.
"‘ I will scatter you among the nations. War will follow you. Your country will be in ruins. Your cities will be deserted.
"‘ Then the land will enjoy its time to honor Jehovah while it lies deserted. You will be in your enemies' land. Then the land will joyfully celebrate its time to honor Jehovah.
"‘ I will fill those who are left in the land of their enemies with despair. The sound of a windblown leaf will make them run. They will run away and fall, but no one will be chasing them.
"‘ They will stumble over each other. Yet no one will be after them. They will not be able to stand up to their enemies.
"‘ They will be destroyed among the nations. The land of their enemies will devour them.
"‘ Those who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
"‘ However if they confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors and the treacherous things they did to oppose me,
"‘ I will oppose them and bring them into the lands of their enemies. Then, if they humble their uncircumcised hearts and accept their guilt,
"‘ I will remember my promise to Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham. I will also remember the land.
"‘ The land, abandoned by them, will enjoy its time to honor Jehovah while it lies deserted without them. They must accept their guilt because they rejected my rules and looked at my laws with disgust.
"‘ Even when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or look at them with disgust. I will not reject or cancel my promise to them, because I am Jehovah their God.
"‘ For their well being, I will remember the promise to their ancestors. I brought them out of Egypt to be their God while nations looked on. I am Jehovah! ’"
These are the laws, rules, and instructions Jehovah gave to the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"Give the following regulations for the people of Israel: ‘ When any of you have been given to Jehovah in fulfillment of a special vow, you may be set free by the payment of the following sums of money,
"‘ This is according to the official standard: adult male, twenty to sixty years old: fifty pieces of silver, adult female: thirty pieces of silver, young male, five to twenty years old: twenty pieces of silver, young female: ten pieces of silver, infant male under five: five pieces of silver, infant female: three pieces of silver, male above sixty years of age: fifteen pieces of silver, female above sixty: ten pieces of silver.
"‘ The person who is too poor to pay the required amount must stand in front of the priest. The priest will determine the amount based on what the person can afford.
"‘ If the vow is to give the kind of animal that people offer to Jehovah, it will be considered holy.
"‘ Do not exchange or substitute animals, a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one. If you do exchange one animal for another, then both animals will be holy.
"‘ If it is an unclean animal that cannot be brought to Jehovah as an offering, bring it in front of the priest.
"‘ The priest will determine what its value is. The value will be whatever the priest decides.
"‘ If you want to buy it back, you must pay its full value plus one-fifth more.
"‘ If you give your house to Jehovah as something holy, the priest will determine what its value is. The value will be whatever the priest decides.
"‘ If you want to buy it back, you must pay its full value plus one-fifth more.
"‘ If a person gives part of a field to Jehovah as something holy, its value will be based on the seed planted on it. Ground planted with two quarts of barley will be worth twenty ounces of silver.
"‘ If you give your field in the jubilee year, it will have its full value.
"‘ Should you give the field after the jubilee year, the priest will estimate its value based on the number of years left until the next jubilee year.
"‘ If you want to buy it back, you must pay its full value plus one-fifth more.
"‘ If you do not buy it back and it is sold to someone else, it may not be redeemed.
"‘ When the field is released in the jubilee year, it will be holy like a field claimed by Jehovah. It will become the property of the priest.
"‘ You may give a field you bought, not one that was a part of your family property, to Jehovah as something holy.
"‘ The priest must figure out the field's value until the jubilee year. You will pay its value on that day as something holy, belonging to Jehovah.
"‘ In the jubilee year the field will go back to the person from whom it was bought, to whom it belongs as family property.
"‘ All values will be set using the standard weight of the holy place.
"‘ A firstborn animal already belongs to Jehovah because it was born first. Therefore, it cannot be set apart as holy. Whether it is a bull or a sheep, it belongs to Jehovah.
"‘ If it is an unclean animal it must be bought back. The payment will be its full value plus one-fifth more. If it is not bought back, it must be sold at the value given it.
"‘ However, everything dedicated to Jehovah for destruction, a person, an animal, or a field that belongs to you, must not be sold or bought back. Everything dedicated in that way is very holy. It belongs to Jehovah.
"‘ People dedicated this way may not be bought back. They must be put to death.
"‘ One-tenth of what comes from the land, whether grain or fruit, is holy and belongs to Jehovah.
"‘ If you buy back any part of it, you must add one-fifth more to it.
"‘ Every tenth head of cattle or sheep that you counted is holy and belongs to Jehovah.
"‘ You must not look to see if it is good or bad or exchange it. If you do exchange it, both the first animal and its substitute will be holy. They may not be bought back. ’"
These are the commandments Jehovah gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
Jehovah spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Desert of Sinai. It was the first day of the second month in the second year after leaving Egypt. He said:
"Take a census of all the males of the congregation of Israel by families and households. List every man by name
who is at least twenty years old. You and Aaron must register everyone in Israel who is eligible for military duty. List them by divisions.
"One man from each tribe will help you. Each of these men must be the head of a household.
"Here are the names of the men who will help you: Elizur, son of Shedeur, from the tribe of Reuben,
Moses and Aaron took the men who had been named
and assembled the whole congregation on the first day of the second month. Each man at least twenty years old provided his genealogy by family and household. Then his name was listed.
Moses registered the men of Israel in the Desert of Sinai as Jehovah commanded him.
The households from the tribe of Levi were not registered along with the other Israelites.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Do not register the tribe of Levi or include them in the census with the other Israelites.
"Put the Levites in charge of the tent of God’s words, including the equipment for the tent and everything else having to do with the tent. The Levites will carry the tent and all its equipment. They will take care of the tent and camp around it.
"When the tent is to be moved, the Levites will take it down. When we camp, they will set it up. Anyone else who comes near the tent will be put to death.
"The other Israelites will camp with each family in its own area under its own flag.
"The Levites will camp all around the tent of God’s words. In this way Jehovah will not be angry with the congregation of Israel. So the Levites will be in charge of the tent of God’s words."
The Israelites did everything as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron:
"The Israelites will put up their tents with each family under the flag that symbolizes its household. They will locate their tents around and facing the tent of meeting.
"On the east side, facing the rising sun, the armies led by Judah will camp under their flag. The leader for the people of Judah is Nahshon, son of Amminadab.
"On the south side the armies led by Reuben will camp under their flag. The leader for the people of Reuben is Elizur, son of Shedeur
"When the tent of meeting is moved, the Levites will stay in the middle of the groups. The tribes will move out in the same order as they are in the camp, everyone in place under his own flag staff scepter.
"On the west side the armies led by Ephraim will camp under their flag. Elishama, son of Ammihud is the leader for the people of Ephraim.
"On the north side the armies led by Dan will camp under their flag. The leader for the people of Dan is Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai.
This is the total number of Israelites, counted by households. The grand total of all the troops in the camps was six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
As Jehovah had commanded Moses, the Levites were not registered along with the other Israelites.
The Israelites did everything as Jehovah had commanded Moses. They set up camp under their flags, and each person traveled with his own family and household.
This is the list of Aaron and Moses’ descendants when Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
The names of Aaron’s sons are Nadab firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
These are the names of Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
Nadab and Abihu died in Jehovah’s presence because they offered unauthorized fire in his presence in the Desert of Sinai. They had no children. So only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Bring the tribe of Levi, and have them stand in front of the priest Aaron to assist him.
"They will work for him and the whole community in front of the tent of meeting, doing what needs to be done for the inner tent.
"They will take care of all the furnishings in the tent of meeting and work for the Israelites, doing what needs to be done for the inner tent.
"Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. The Levites will be the only Israelites given to them.
"Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests. Anyone else who tries to do the priests’ duties must be put to death."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Out of all the Israelites, I have taken the Levites to be substitutes for every firstborn male offspring among them. The Levites are mine,
Jehovah said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai:
"Count the Levites by households and families. Count every male who is at least one month old."
Moses did what Jehovah said. He registered them as he had been commanded.
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari were the sons of Levi.
To Gershon belonged the families descended from Libni and Shimei. These were the families descended from Gershon.
The total number of all the males at least one month old was seven thousand five hundred.
The families descended from Gershon put up their tents on the west side behind the tent of meeting.
The leader of the Gershonite households was Eliasaph, son of Lael.
The Gershonites were in charge of the inner tent, the outer tent and cover, the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting,
the curtains for the courtyard, the screen for the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the inner tent and the altar, and the ropes. They took care of all these things.
To Kohath belonged the families descended from Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. These were the families descended from Kohath.
The number of all the males at least one month old was eight thousand six hundred. They were in charge of the holy place.
The families descended from Kohath put up their tents on the south side of the tent of meeting.
The leader of the Kohathite families and households was Elizaphan, son of Uzziel.
They were in charge of the Ark, the table, the lamp stand, the altars, the utensils used in the holy place, and the screen. They took care of all these things.
The leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest. He was in charge of those who carried out the duties in the Holy Place.
The clan of Merari was composed of the families of Mahli and Mushi.
The total number of males one month old or older that were enrolled was six thousand two hundred.
This clan was to camp on the north side of the Tent, with Zuriel son of Abihail as leader of the clan.
It was the duty of the Merarites to be in charge of the framework of the inner tent, the crossbars, posts, sockets, and all the equipment. They took care of these things.
They were responsible for the posts for the surrounding courtyard, the bases, pegs, and ropes.
Moses, Aaron, and his sons put up their tents on the east side in front of the tent of meeting. They were in charge of the holy place on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who tried to do the Levites’ duties had to be put to death.
The grand total of Levites that Moses and Aaron counted at Jehovah’s command, by families, every male who was at least one month old, was twenty-two thousand.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Register every firstborn male of the Israelites who is at least one month old, and make a list of their names.
Moses registered all the firstborn Israelites as Jehovah commanded him.
The total of all the firstborn males at least one month old was twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy three. They were listed by name.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Take the Levites to be substitutes for all the firstborn Israelites and the animals of the Levites to be substitutes for their animals. The Levites will be mine. I am Jehovah.
"There are two hundred and seventy-three more firstborn male Israelites than there are Levites.
"It will cost you two ounces of silver per person, using the standard weight of the holy place, to buy them back.
"Give the silver to Aaron and his sons. It will buy back those Israelites who outnumber the Levites."
Moses took this ransom money from the Israelites who outnumbered the Levites.
Then Moses did what Jehovah said and gave Aaron and his sons this ransom money as he had been commanded.
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
"Take a census of the Levites who are descended from Kohath. List them by families and households.
"Register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are qualified to work at the tent of meeting.
"This is the work the Kohathites will do in the tent of meeting: They will take care of the most holy things.
"When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons will go in and take down the canopy that hangs over the Ark containing the words of God’s Covenant. First they will cover the Ark with the canopy.
"Over this they will put a covering of fine leather. On top of that they will spread a cloth made entirely of violet material. Then they will put the poles in place.
"They will spread a violet cloth over the table of the presence and put on it the plates, dishes, bowls, and pitchers for the wine offerings. The bread that is always in Jehovah’s presence will also be on it.
"They will spread a bright red cloth over everything on the table. They will then cover all this with fine leather. Then they will put the poles in place.
"They will use a violet cloth to cover the lamp stand, as well as the lamps, snuffers, trays, and all the containers for the olive oil used in the lamps.
"Then they will put the lamp stand and all its utensils under a covering of fine leather and put them on a frame to carry them.
"They will spread a violet cloth over the gold altar and cover the cloth with fine leather. Then they will put the poles in place.
"They will take all the articles that are used in the holy place and put them in a violet cloth. Then they will cover that with fine leather, and put them on a frame to carry them.
"After they take the ashes away, they will spread a purple cloth over the altar.
"They will put all the accessories used at the altar on it. These are the trays, forks, shovels, and bowls-all the altar’s accessories. They will spread a covering of fine leather sealskin over all this. Then they will put the poles in place.
"When Aaron and his sons finished covering the holy things and the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites will come to carry all the holy articles. They must never touch the holy things, or they will die. The Kohathites will carry all the things from the tent of meeting.
"Eleazar, son of the priest Aaron, will be in charge of the oil for the lamps, the sweet-smelling incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. He is in charge of the whole tent and everything in it, the holy place and its contents."
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron:
"Do not let the Kohathite families from Levi’s tribe be destroyed.
"This is what you must do so that they will not die when they come near the most holy things: Aaron and his sons will go into the holy place and tell each man what he will do and what he will carry.
"However the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Take a census of the Gershonites. List them by households and families.
"Register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are qualified to serve at the tent of meeting.
"This is what the Gershonite families will do and what they will carry:
"They will carry the sheets that are part of the inner tent and the tent of meeting. They will also carry the inner cover for the tent of meeting, the outer cover of fine leather that goes over it, the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting,
the curtains for the courtyard around the tent and the altar, the screen for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes, and all the equipment used to set up the curtains. The Gershonites will do everything that needs to be done with these things.
"All their work, whatever they carry and all their duties, will be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You are in charge of telling them everything they are to carry.
"This is the work of the Gershonite families in the tent of meeting. Ithamar, son of the priest Aaron, will be in charge of them.
"Register the Merarites by families and households.
"Register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are qualified to serve at the tent of meeting.
"These are their duties as they work at the tent of meeting: They will carry the framework for the inner tent, the crossbars, posts, and sockets,
the posts for the surrounding courtyard, the bases, pegs, and ropes. They must take care of all this equipment. Tell each man by name the things he will carry.
"This is what the Merarite families will do as they work at the tent of meeting. Ithamar, son of the priest Aaron, will be in charge of them."
Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation registered the Kohathites by their families and households.
At Jehovah’s command through Moses each man was registered and told what to do and what to carry. So they were registered as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Command the Israelites to send outside the camp anyone who has a serious skin disease or a discharge or anyone who is unclean from touching a dead body.
"Send all of these unclean men and women outside the camp. They must not make this camp where I live among you unclean."
Thus the Israelites did as Jehovah told Moses. They sent these unclean people outside the camp.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ If you do something wrong to another person, you have been unfaithful to Jehovah. When you realize your guilt,
you must confess your sin, pay in full for what you did wrong, add one-fifth to it, and give it to the person who was wronged.
"‘ There may be no heir to whom the payment can be made. In that case, the payment for what you did wrong must be given to Jehovah for the priest to use. This payment is in addition to the ram that is used to pay compensation for the wrongdoing makes peace with Jehovah.
"‘ Any contribution over and above the holy offerings that the Israelites bring to the priest belongs to the priest.
"‘ Each person’s holy offerings will belong to that person. Everything given to the priest will belong to the priest. ’"
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘ A man’s wife may have been unfaithful to him
"‘ He must then take his wife to the priest along with eight cups of barley flour as an offering for her. He must not pour olive oil on the flour or put frankincense on it, since it is a grain offering brought because of the husband’s jealousy. It is an offering used for a confession, to remind someone of a sin that was committed.
"‘ The priest will have the woman come forward and stand in Jehovah’s presence.
"‘ The priest will then take holy water in a piece of pottery and put some dust from the floor of the tent into the water.
"‘ The priest will bring the woman into Jehovah’s presence and loosen her hair. In her hands he will put the offering used for a confession, that is, the grain offering brought because of the husband’s jealousy. The priest will hold the bitter water that can bring a curse in his hands.
"‘ The priest will say to her: ‘ If no other man has had sexual intercourse with you and you have not been unfaithful to your husband, you are not guilty. This bitter water that can bring a curse will not harm you.
"‘ If you have indeed been unfaithful and have had sexual intercourse with another man,
"‘ Jehovah will make you an example for your people to see what happens when the curse of this oath comes true: Jehovah will make your uterus drop and your stomach swell. Then the priest will administer the oath and the curse by saying:
"‘ May this water that can bring a curse go into your body and make your stomach swell and your uterus drop! ’" Then the woman will say: "Amen!" "Amen!"
"The priest will write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.
"He will have the woman drink the bitter water that can bring the curse. This water will go into her and become bitter.
"The priest will take the grain offering she was holding. He will present it to Jehovah, and bring it to the altar.
"The priest will take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Then he will have the woman drink the water.
"If she has become unclean by being unfaithful to her husband, the water that can bring the curse will go into her and become bitter. Her stomach will swell, her uterus will drop, and she will become cursed among her people.
"However if the woman is not unclean and is pure, she is not guilty and will be able to have children.
"These are the instructions for how to deal with jealousy. They tell you what to do when a woman is unfaithful to her husband and becomes unclean.
"The husband is not guilty of doing anything wrong. But the woman will suffer the consequences of her sin."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ A man or a woman may make a special vow to live as a Nazirite dedicated to Jehovah.
"‘ Nazirites must never drink wine, liquor, vinegar made from wine or liquor, or any kind of grape juice. They must never eat fresh grapes or raisins.
"‘ As long as they are Nazirites they must never eat anything that comes from a grapevine, not even grape seeds or skins.
"‘ As long as they are under the Nazirite vow no razor may touch their heads. During the entire time that they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites, they will be holy. They must let their hair grow long.
"‘ While they are dedicated to Jehovah as Nazirites, they must never go near a dead body.
"‘ As long as they are Nazirites, they will be holy to Jehovah.
"‘ Someone might suddenly drop dead next to a Nazirite and make the Nazirite’s hair unclean. Seven days later he must shave his head in order to be declared clean.
"‘ The eighth day he must bring two mourning doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
"‘ The priest will sacrifice one as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering. The priest will pay compensation for the wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the person who touched the dead body. That same day the person must dedicate his head again.
"‘ Once again he will dedicate himself to Jehovah as a Nazirite for the same length of time as before. He must bring a one-year-old male lamb as an offering for guilt. The first time period will not count. He has to start over from when he became unclean.
"‘ These are the instructions for Nazirites to complete their vows: They must come to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
"‘ They are to bring these offerings to Jehovah: a one-year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, a one-year-old female lamb as an offering for sin, and a ram as a fellowship offering. All of these animals must have no defects.
"‘ They must also bring a basket of unleavened bread containing some rings of bread made with olive oil and wafers of unleavened bread brushed with olive oil, along with other grain offerings and wine offerings.
"‘ The priest will bring these offerings to Jehovah. He will make the offering for sin and the burnt offering.
"‘ He will sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to Jehovah. He will offer the basket of unleavened bread along with it, and make the grain offerings and wine offerings.
"‘ The Nazirites will shave their heads at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then they will take the hair as proof that they had made this vow, and put it on the fire under the fellowship offering.
"‘ The priest will take one of the shoulders from a boiled ram, one ring of unleavened bread from the basket, and one wafer of unleavened bread and hand them to the Nazirites after they have shaved off their hair.
"‘ The priest will present them as an offering to Jehovah. They are holy and belong to the priest, along with the ram’s breast that is presented and the thigh that is given. After that, the Nazirites may drink wine. ’"
"These are the instructions for those who have vowed to bring their offerings to Jehovah as Nazirites. They must bring these offerings in addition to anything else they can afford. They must fulfill the requirements of these instructions for Nazirites and finish whatever they vowed to do."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Tell Aaron and his sons: ‘ This is how you will bless the Israelites. Say to them:
"‘ "Jehovah will bless you and watch over you." ’"
"‘ "Jehovah will smile on you and be kind to you.
"‘ "Jehovah will look on you with favor and give you peace!
"‘ "Whenever they use my name to bless the Israelites, I will bless them." ’"
Moses finished setting up the tent. He anointed it and dedicated it and all the furnishings. He also anointed and dedicated the altar and all the utensils.
The leaders of Israel, the heads of the households, those tribal leaders who helped in the census came to give their offerings.
They brought these gifts to Jehovah: six freight wagons and twelve oxen, one wagon from every two leaders and one ox from each leader. They brought them in front of the tent.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Accept these gifts from them to use in the work done for the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites to use where they need them for their work."
Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites for the work they had to do.
He gave four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites for the work they had to do under the direction of Ithamar, son of the priest Aaron.
However Moses gave none of these gifts to the Kohathites, because they took care of the holy things. They had to carry the holy things on their own shoulders.
The leaders also brought offerings for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed. They presented their gifts in front of the altar.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Each day a different leader will bring his gift for the dedication of the altar."
These were the gifts from the leaders of Israel for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed: twelve silver plates, twelve silver bowls, and twelve gold dishes.
When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Jehovah, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the throne of mercy on the Ark containing the words of God’s Covenant, from between the two cherubim. This is how Jehovah spoke with Moses.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Speak to Aaron and tell him: ‘ When you set up the seven lamps on the lamp stand, they should illuminate the area in front of it. ’"
So Aaron set up the lamps on the lamp stand to illuminate the area in front of it, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
This is how the lamp stand was made: The whole lamp stand, from top to bottom, was hammered out of gold. It was made exactly like the one Jehovah had shown Moses.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites. Make them clean.
"This is what you must do to make them clean: Sprinkle them with water to take away their sins. Make them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. Then they will be clean.
"They must take a young bull and the grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil that is offered with it. You must take a second young bull as an offering for sin.
"Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting. Assemble the whole congregation of Israel.
"Then bring the Levites into Jehovah’s presence, and the Israelites will place their hands on them.
"Aaron will present the Levites to Jehovah as an offering from the Israelites. Then they will be ready to do Jehovah’s work.
"The Levites will place their hands on the heads of the young bulls. Sacrifice one of them as an offering for sin and the other one as a burnt offering to Jehovah. These sacrifices will pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah for the Levites.
"Make the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and present them as an offering to Jehovah.
"In this way you will separate the Levites from the other Israelites. The Levites will be mine.
"Once you have made them clean and presented them as an offering, the Levites may come and do their work at the tent of meeting.
"They will be the only Israelites given to me. I have taken them to be mine as substitutes for every firstborn male offspring of the Israelites.
"When I killed all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal.
"I am now taking the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites.
"I assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as a gift from the Israelites. They are to work in the tent for the people of Israel and to protect the Israelites from the disaster that would strike them if they came too near the Holy Place."
Moses, Aaron, and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
So the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron dedicated them as a special gift to Jehovah. He also performed the ritual of purification for them.
The people did everything Jehovah commanded Moses concerning the Levites. Thus the Levites were qualified to work in the tent under Aaron and his sons.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"From the age of twenty-five each Levite shall perform his duties in the tent of my presence,
"They must retire from active service when they are fifty years old.
"They may assist the other Levites in their duties at the tent of meeting. But they may not do any regular work. This is how you will handle the Levites’ duties."
Jehovah spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after the Israelites left Egypt. He said:
"The Israelites should celebrate the Passover at the same time every year.
So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover.
They celebrated it on the fourteenth day of the first month at dusk while they were in the Desert of Sinai. The Israelites did everything as Jehovah commanded Moses.
There were some men who had become unclean from touching a dead body. They could not celebrate the Passover that day. They went to Moses and Aaron.
They said: "We are unclean because we touched a dead body. Why are we prevented from making our offerings to Jehovah at the same time the rest of the Israelites bring their offerings?"
Moses answered: "Wait here until I find out what Jehovah commands you to do."
Jehovah said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites:
"‘ Should you or any of your descendants be unclean from touching a dead body or away on a long trip. You may still celebrate the Passover.
"‘ You will celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at dusk. Eat the Passover animal along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
"‘ Never leave any of the meat until morning or break any of the animal’s bones. Follow all the rules for the Passover when you celebrate it.
"‘ If you are clean and not on a trip and yet do not bother to celebrate the Passover, you must be excluded from the people. You did not bring your offering to Jehovah at the right time. You must suffer the consequences for your sin.
"‘ Foreigners living with you may want to celebrate Jehovah’s Passover. They must follow these same rules and regulations. The same rules will apply to foreigners and native-born Israelites. ’"
That day the tent of the words of God’s Covenant was set up. The column of smoke covered it. The smoke over the tent glowed like fire from evening until morning.
When the smoke moved from the tent the Israelites would break camp. Wherever it stopped the Israelites would set up camp.
The Israelites would break camp or set up camp at Jehovah’s command. They stayed at the place where the column of smoke stayed over the tent.
When the smoke stayed over the tent for a long time, the Israelites obeyed Jehovah’s command and did not break camp.
The same thing happened when the smoke stayed only a few days over the tent: At Jehovah’s command they would set up camp, and at his command they would break camp.
Sometimes the column of smoke stayed only from evening until morning. They broke camp when the smoke moved in the morning. Day or night, when the smoke moved, they broke camp.
Whether it was two days, a month, or a year, as long as the column of smoke stayed over the tent, the Israelites stayed in the same place. But when the smoke moved, they would break camp and move.
At Jehovah’s command they set up camp, and at his command they broke camp. They obeyed the command Jehovah gave through Moses.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Make two trumpets of hammered silver to use for calling the people together and for breaking camp.
"When long blasts are sounded on both trumpets, the whole community is to gather around you at the entrance to the tent of my presence.
"When only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders of the clans are to gather around you.
"When short blasts are sounded, the tribes camped on the east will move out.
"When short blasts are sounded a second time, the tribes on the south will move out. So short blasts are to be sounded to break camp,
"Long blasts are to be sounded to call the congregation together.
"Aaron’s sons the priests are to blow the trumpets. The following rule is to be observed for all time to come.
"When there is war in your land and you defend yourselves against an enemy attack, sound the signal for battle on these trumpets. I, Jehovah your God, will help you and save you from your enemies.
"Joyful occasions such as your New Moon Festivals and your other religious festivals, you are to blow the trumpets when you present your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings. Then I will help you. I AM JEHOVAH YOUR GOD!"
The cloud over the tent of Jehovah’s presence lifted the twentieth day of the second month in the second year after the people left Egypt.
At last the Israelites started on their journey out of the Sinai Desert. The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran.
Jehovah gave the command through Moses for them to march.
They were in the same order each time they moved. Those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Judah started out first, company by company, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.
Nethanel son of Zuar was in command of the tribe of Issachar.
Eliab son of Helon was in command of the tribe of Zebulun.
Then the tent would be taken down. The clans of Gershon and Merari carried it.
Next, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Reuben would start out, company by company. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.
Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was in command of the tribe of Simeon,
and Eliasaph son of Deuel was in command of the tribe of Gad.
The Levite clan of Kohath started the march. They carried the sacred objects. By the time they arrived at the next camp, the tent had been set up again.
Next, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Ephraim would start out, company by company, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command.
Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanded the tribe of Manasseh.
Abidan son of Gideoni commanded the tribe of Benjamin.
Finally, the banner of the division led by the tribe of Dan, serving as the rear guard of all the divisions, started out, company by company. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.
Pagiel son of Ochran commanded the tribe of Asher.
Ahira son of Enan commanded the tribe of Naphtali.
This was the order of march, company by company, when the Israelites broke camp and set out.
Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Jethro the Midianite: We are about to start out for the place Jehovah said he would give us. He promised to make Israel prosperous, so come with us, and we will share our prosperity with you.
Hobab answered: "No, I am going back to my native land."
« Please do not leave us," Moses said. "You know where we can camp in the desert. You can be our guide.
"If you come with us, we will share with you all the blessings that Jehovah gives us."
The people left Sinai, the holy mountain. They traveled three days. Jehovah’s Ark of the Covenant always went ahead of them to find a place for them to camp.
They moved camp to camp with the cloud of Jehovah over them by day.
When the Ark of the Covenant started out, Moses would say: "ARISE, JEHOVAH; scatter your enemies and put to flight those who hate you!"
And when it stopped, he would say: "RETURN, O JEHOVAH, to the countless thousands of Israel!"
The people complained out loud to Jehovah about their troubles. Jehovah heard them and he became angry. Fire from Jehovah burned among them. It destroyed some people on the outskirts of the camp.
The people cried out to Moses. Moses prayed to Jehovah! And the fire died down.
That place was called Taberah Fire because fire from Jehovah burned among them there.
Some foreigners among the Israelites had a strong craving for other kinds of food. Even the Israelites cried again and said: "If only we had meat to eat!
"Remember all the free fish we ate in Egypt and the cucumbers, watermelons, leeks, onions, and garlic we had?
"Now we have lost our appetite! Everywhere we look there is nothing but manna!"
Manna was small like coriander seeds and looked like resin.
The people would gather it and then grind it in a hand mill or crush it in a mortar. They would cook it in a pot or make round loaves of bread out of it. It tasted like rich sweet pastry made with oil.
Moses heard people from every family cry at the entrance to their tents. Jehovah became very angry. Moses did not like it either.
So he asked: "Jehovah, why have you brought me this trouble? How have I displeased you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
"Am I their mother? Did I give birth to them? Are you really asking me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries a baby, all the way to the land you promised their ancestors with an oath?
"Where can I get meat for all these people? They continually cry for me to give them meat to eat.
"I am not able to take care of all these people by myself. This is too much work for me!
"If you treat me like this have pity on me and kill me. That way I will not have to endure my shame any longer."
Jehovah replied to Moses: "Assemble seventy respected men who are recognized as elders of the people. Bring them to me at the tent of my presence, and tell them to stand there beside you.
"I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the spirit I have given and give it to them. Then they can help you bear the responsibility for these people. You will not have to bear it alone.
"Tell the people: ‘ Purify yourselves for tomorrow. You will have meat to eat! Jehovah has heard you whining and saying that you wished you had some meat and that you were better off in Egypt. Jehovah will now give you meat, and you will have to eat it.
"‘ You will have to eat it not just for one or two days, or five, or ten, or even twenty days.
"‘ You will eat it for a whole month, until it comes out of your nose, until you are sick of it. This will happen because you have rejected Jehovah who is here among you and have complained to him that you should not have left Egypt. ’"
Moses said to Jehovah: "Here I am leading six hundred thousand people, and you say that you will give them enough meat for a month?"
"Could enough cattle and sheep even be killed to satisfy them? Are all the fish in the sea enough for them?
"Is there a limit to my power?" Jehovah answered. "You will soon see whether what I have said will happen or not!"
Thus Moses went out and told the people what Jehovah said. He assembled seventy of the leaders and placed them around the tent.
Jehovah came down in the cloud and spoke to him. He took some of the spirit he had given to Moses and gave it to the seventy elders. When the Spirit came on them, they began to shout like prophets, but not for long.
Two of the seventy elders, Eldad and Medad, stayed in the camp and did not go out to the tent. There in the camp the Spirit came on them, and they too began to shout like prophets.
A young man ran out to tell Moses what Eldad and Medad were doing.
Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ helper since he was a young man, spoke up and said to Moses: "Stop them, sir!"
Moses asked him: "Do you think you need to stand up for me? I wish all Jehovah’s people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his Spirit on them!"
Then Moses and the elders of Israel went back to the camp.
Jehovah sent a wind from the sea that brought quails and dropped them all around the camp. There were quails on the ground about three feet deep as far as you could walk in a day in any direction.
All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered the quails. No one gathered less than sixty bushels. Then they spread the quails out all around the camp.
While the meat was still in their mouths, before they had even had a chance to chew it, Jehovah became angry with the people and struck them with a severe plague.
That place was called Kibroth Hattaavah Graves of Those Who Craved Meat because they buried the people who had a strong craving for meat there.
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, where they stayed.
Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he was married to a Cushite woman from Sudan.
They asked: "Did Jehovah speak only through Moses? Did he not also speak through us? Jehovah heard their complaint.
Moses was a very humble meek man. He was more humble than anyone else on earth.
Suddenly, Jehovah said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam: "All three of you come to the tent of meeting." So all three of them went to the tent.
Then Jehovah came down in the column of smoke and stood at the entrance to the tent. He called to Aaron and Miriam. They both came forward.
He said: "Listen to my words: ‘ When there are prophets of Jehovah among you, I make myself known to them in visions or speak to them in dreams.
"‘ But this is not the way I treat my servant Moses. He is the most faithful person in my household.
"‘ I speak with him face to face. I speak plainly and not in riddles. He even sees the form of Jehovah. Why were you not afraid to criticize my servant Moses? ’"
Jehovah was angry with them, so he left.
After the smoke left the tent, Miriam was covered with an infectious skin disease. She was as white as snow. Aaron turned to her and saw she was covered with the disease.
He said to Moses: "Please, do not make us suffer this punishment for our foolish sin.
"Do not let her become like something born dead with half its flesh eaten away."
Therefore Moses cried out to Jehovah: "O God, heal her!"
Jehovah answered: "If her father had spit in her face, she would have to bear her disgrace for seven days. So let her be shut out of the camp for a week, and after that she can be brought back in."
Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days. The people did not move on until she was brought back in.
Then they left Hazeroth and set up camp in the wilderness of Paran.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Choose one of the leaders from each of the twelve tribes and send them as spies to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites."
According to Jehovah’s command, Moses sent these men from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
These are their names: Shammua, son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben,
Shaphat, son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon;
Caleb, son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;
Igal, son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar;
Hoshea, son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim;
Palti, son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin;
Gaddiel, son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun;
Gaddi, son of Susi, from the tribe of Joseph, that is, the tribe of Manasseh;
Ammiel, son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan;
Sethur, son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher;
Nahbi, son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali;
and Geuel, son of Machi, from the tribe of Gad.
These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. But Moses gave Hoshea, son of Nun, the name Joshua.
When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he told them: "Go through the Negev and then into the mountain region.
"See what the land is like and whether the people there are strong or weak, few or many.
"Is the land they live in good or bad? Do their cities have walls around them or not?
"Is the soil rich or poor? Does the land have trees or not? Do your best to bring back some fruit from the land." It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen.
So they spied on the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath.
When they went to the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
At Eshcol Valley they cut off a branch with only one bunch of grapes on it. They carried it on a pole between two of them. They also brought some pomegranates and figs.
So they called that valley Eshcol Bunch of Grapes because of the bunch of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
Forty days later they returned from exploring the land.
They returned to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. They gave their report and showed them the fruit from the land.
This is their report to Moses: "We went to the land where you sent us. It really is a land flowing with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit.
"The people who live there are strong. The cities have walls and are very large. We even saw the descendants of Anak there.
"The Amalekites live in the Negev. The Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the mountain region. The Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and all along the Jordan River."
Caleb told the people to be quiet and listen to Moses. Caleb said: "Let us go now and take possession of the land. We should be more than able to conquer it."
The men who had gone with him said: "We cannot attack those people! They are too strong for us!
"They spread lies among the Israelites about the land they had explored. They said: The land we explored is one that devours those who live there. All the people we saw there are very tall.
"We saw Nephilim there. The descendants of Anak are Nephilim. We felt as small as grasshoppers. That is no doubt how we must have looked to them."
All the Israelite congregation raised their voices and cried out loud all that night.
They complained to Moses and Aaron: "If only we had died in Egypt or in this desert!
"Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land? Is it just to have us die in battle? Our wives and children will be taken as prisoners of war! Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
They said to each other: "Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
Immediately, Moses and Aaron bowed with their faces touching the ground in front of the whole congregation of Israel assembled there.
At the same time, two of those who had explored the land, Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, tore their clothes in despair.
They said to the entire congregation of Israel: "The land we explored is very good.
"If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will take us there and give us that rich and fertile land.
"Do not rebel against Jehovah. Do not be afraid of the people who live there. We will conquer them easily. Jehovah is with us and has defeated the gods who protected them. Do not be afraid."
The whole congregation threatened to stone them to death. Then suddenly the people saw the dazzling light of Jehovah’s presence glory splendor appear over the tent.
Jehovah said to Moses: "How much longer will these people reject me? How much longer will they refuse to trust in me, even though I have performed many miracles among them?
"I will send an epidemic and destroy them. I will make you the father of a nation that is larger and more powerful than they are!"
Moses said to Jehovah: "You brought these people out of Egypt by your power. When the Egyptians hear what you have done to your people,
they will tell it to the people who live in this land. These people have already heard that you, Jehovah, are with us, that you appear in plain sight when your cloud stops over us, and that you go before us in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
"But if you kill all these people at the same time the nations who have heard these reports about you will say,
"Jehovah was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them, so he slaughtered them in the desert.
"Jehovah, let your power be as great as when you said,
"Jehovah is patient, forever loving; He forgives wrongdoing and disobedience. He never lets the guilty go unpunished. In fact he punishes children for their parents’ sins to the third and fourth generation.
"By your great love, please forgive these people’s sins, as you have forgiven them from the time they left Egypt until now."
Jehovah said: "I forgive them, as you have asked.
"But as I live and as the glory of Jehovah fills the whole earth, I solemnly swear that
none of the people who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I did in Egypt and in the desert will see the land I promised their ancestors. They have tested me now ten times and refused to obey me.
"None of those who treat me with contempt will see it!
"My servant Caleb has a different attitude and has wholeheartedly followed me, I will bring him to the land he already explored. His descendants will possess it.
"The Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys. Tomorrow you must turn around, go back into the desert. Follow the road that goes to the Red Sea."
Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
"How long must I put up with this wicked congregation that keeps complaining about me? I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making about me.
"Therefore tell them: ‘ As I live, declares Jehovah, I solemnly swear I will do everything to you that you said I would do.
"‘ Your bodies will drop dead in this desert. All of you who are at least twenty years old, who were registered and listed, and who complained about me will die.
"‘ I raised my hand and swore an oath to give you this land to live in. But none of you will enter it except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
"‘ You said your children would be taken as prisoners of war. Instead, I will bring them into the land you rejected, and they will enjoy it.
"‘ But your bodies will drop dead in this desert.
"‘ Your children will be shepherds in the desert for forty years. They will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies dead in the desert.
"‘ You explored the land for forty days. So for forty years, one year for each day, you will suffer for your sins and know what it means for me to be against you. ’
"‘ I, Jehovah, have spoken. I swear I will do these things to all the people in this whole wicked congregation. For they have joined forces against me. They will meet their end in this desert. Here they will die! ’"
The men Moses sent to explore the land died in front of Jehovah from a plague.
Of all the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
Moses told these things to all the Israelites. The people mourned bitterly, as if someone had died.
Early the next morning they headed into the mountains. They said: "We have sinned. Now we will go to the place Jehovah promised."
Moses asked: "Why are you disobeying Jehovah’s command? Your plan will not work!
"Do not go! Your enemies will defeat you because Jehovah is not with you.
"The Amalekites and Canaanites are there. You will die in battle. Now that you have turned away from Jehovah, he will not be with you."
But they headed into the mountains anyway. The Ark of the Jehovah’s promise and Moses stayed in the camp.
The Amalekites and Canaanites who lived there came down from those mountains, attacked the Israelites, and defeated them at Hormah.
Jehovah said to Moses:
Speak to the Israelites and tell them: "Once you are settled in the land I am giving you,
you must bring offerings by fire to Jehovah. They may be burnt offerings or any other kind of sacrifice. They may be offered to fulfill a vow, as a freewill offering, or as one of your festival offerings. They may be cattle, sheep, or goats. These are offerings that are a soothing pleasant restful aroma to Jehovah.
"Whoever presents the offering must also give Jehovah a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with one quart of oil.
"With a ram, give a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with one and one quarter quarts of oil
and an offering of one and one quarter quarts of wine. Offer them as a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"When you sacrifice a young bull as a burnt offering to Jehovah or make any other kind of sacrifice to keep a vow or as a fellowship offering.
"Offer with the young bull a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with two quarts of oil.
"Also give an offering of two quarts of wine. It is an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"Do this for each bull, each ram, and each sheep or goat.
"Do it for each animal, however many you sacrifice.
"All native-born Israelites must do it this way when they bring an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"Make a food offering, an odor that pleases Jehovah. If foreigners live among you, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis, they are to observe the same regulations.
"For all time to come, the same rules are binding on you and on the foreigners who live among you. You and they are alike in Jehovah’s sight.
"The same laws and regulations apply to you and to them."
Jehovah gave Moses
the following regulations for the people of Israel. They are to observe them in the land he was going to give them.
"When any food produced there is eaten, some of it is to be set aside as a special contribution to Jehovah.
"When you bake bread, the first loaf of the first bread made from the new grain is to be presented as a special contribution to Jehovah. This is to be presented in the same way as the special contribution you make from the grain you thresh.
"For all time to come, this special gift is to be given to Jehovah from the bread you bake.
"Suppose someone unintentionally fails to keep some of these regulations Jehovah gave Moses.
"Also suppose that in the future the congregation fails to do everything Jehovah commanded through Moses.
"If the mistake was made because of the ignorance of the congregation, they are to offer a bull as a burnt offering, an odor that pleases Jehovah. Use the proper grain offering and wine offering. In addition, they are to offer a male goat as a sin offering.
"The priest will perform the ritual of purification for the congregation. They will be forgiven since the mistake was unintentional and they brought their sin offering as a food offering to Jehovah
"The whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven, because everyone was involved in the mistake.
"If any of you sin unintentionally, you should offer a one-year-old female goat as a sin offering.
"The priest shall perform the ritual of purification at the altar to purify you from your sin. You will be forgiven.
"The same regulation applies to all who unintentionally commit a sin, whether they are native Israelites or resident foreigners.
"Any who sin deliberately, natives or foreigners, are guilty of treating Jehovah with contempt. They shall be put to death.
"They have rejected what Jehovah said and have deliberately broken one of his commandments. They are responsible for their own death."
One time, while the Israelites were still in the wilderness, a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath.
He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation.
They held him in custody until they decided what to do with him.
Jehovah said to Moses: "This man must be put to death. The whole congregation must take him outside the camp and stone him."
So the whole congregation took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Jehovah said to Moses:
Speak to the Israelites and tell them: "For generations to come they must wear tassels on the corners of their clothes. Each tassel should have violet threads.
"When you look at the threads in the tassel, you will remember all Jehovah’s commandments and obey them. Then you will not do whatever you want and go after whatever you see, as if you were chasing after prostitutes.
"You will remember to obey all my commandments. You will be holy to your God.
"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am Jehovah your God!"
Korah son of Izhar, Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth dared to challenge Moses. Korah was a descendant of Kohath and Levi. Dathan, Abiram, and On were descendants of Reuben.
They came together to confront Moses and Aaron. They said: "You have gone far enough! Everyone in the whole congregation is holy. Jehovah is among them. Why do you set yourselves above Jehovah’s assembly?"
When Moses heard this, he bowed with his face touching the ground.
Then he said to Korah and all his followers: "In the morning Jehovah will show who belongs to him, who is holy. He will have that person come near him. Only the person Jehovah chooses will be allowed to come near him.
"Korah, you and all your followers must do this tomorrow: Take incense burners,
Moses also said to Korah: "Listen, you sons of Levi!
"Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel? Jehovah has brought you near to do the work for his tent and stand in front of the community to serve them.
"He brought you and all the other Levites near. But now you demand to be priests.
"You and all your followers have joined forces against Jehovah! Who is Aaron that you should complain about him?"
Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. But they said: "We will not come!
"Is it not enough that you brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey only to kill us in the desert? Do you also have to order us around?
"You have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us any fields and vineyards to own. Do you think you can still pull the wool over our eyes? We will not come."
Moses became angry and said to Jehovah: "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken anything from them, not even a donkey. And I have not mistreated any of them."
Moses said to Korah: "Tomorrow you and all your followers must come into Jehovah’s presence. Aaron will also be there with you.
"Each man will take his incense burner and put incense in it. They will offer all two hundred and fifty incense burners to Jehovah. Then you and Aaron offer your incense burners."
So each man took his incense burner. He put burning coals and incense in it and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Korah assembled all his followers who opposed Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. The glory of Jehovah appeared to the entire group.
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
"Move away from these men. I will destroy them instantly."
Immediately, they bowed with their faces touching the ground and said: "O God, you are the God who gives the breath of life to everyone! If one man sins, will you be angry with the entire congregation?"
Then Jehovah said to Moses:
"Tell the congregation: ‘ Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. ’"
Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
He said to the congregation: "Move away from the tents of these wicked men. Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you ’ ll be swept away because of all their sins."
So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came out and were standing at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children.
Moses said: "This is how you will know that Jehovah sent me to do all these things and that it wasn ’ t my idea:
"If these men die a natural death like all other people Jehovah has not sent me.
"But if Jehovah does something totally new, if the ground opens up, swallows them and everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive to their graves; then you will know that these men have treated Jehovah with contempt."
When he finished speaking, the ground under them split,
and the earth opened up to swallow them, their families, the followers of Korah, and all their property.
They went down alive to their graves with everything that belonged to them. The ground covered them. They disappeared from the assembly.
All the Israelites around them ran away when they heard their screams. They thought the ground would swallow them, also.
Fire came from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.
Then Jehovah said to Moses:
"Tell Eleazar, son of the priest Aaron, to take the incense burners out of the fire and scatter the coals and incense somewhere else. This is because the incense burners have become holy.
"The incense burners of these men who sinned and lost their lives are holy, because they were offered to Jehovah. Hammer them into thin metal sheets to cover the altar. This will be a sign to the Israelites."
The priest Eleazar took the copper incense burners that had been brought by those who had been burned to death. The incense burners were then hammered into thin metal sheets to cover the altar.
He followed Jehovah’s command given through Moses. The copper-covered altar will remind Israel that no one but a descendant of Aaron may come near to burn incense to Jehovah. Everyone else will die like Korah and his followers.
The next day the whole congregation of Israel complained to Moses and Aaron. They said: "You have killed Jehovah’s people."
The congregation came together to confront Moses and Aaron. When they turned toward the tent of meeting, they saw the smoke covering it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Get away from these people, and let me destroy them in an instant! Immediately, they bowed with their faces touching the ground."
Moses said to Aaron: "Take your incense burner, put burning coals from the altar and incense in it, and go quickly into the congregation to make peace with Jehovah for the people. Jehovah shows his anger! A plague has started."
Aaron took his incense burner, as Moses told him. He ran into the middle of the assembly, because the plague had already begun among the people. He put incense on the incense burner to make peace with Jehovah for the people.
He stood between those who had died and those who were still alive. The plague stopped.
Fourteen thousand seven hundred died from the plague in addition to those who died because of Korah.
By the time Aaron came back to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the plague had stopped.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them. Get one from the leader of each of their tribes. Write each man’s name on his staff.
"Write Aaron’s name on the staff for Levi because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe.
"Put them in the tent of meeting where I meet with you, in front of the testimony of my promise.
"The staff from the man I choose will begin to grow. In this way I will silence the frequent complaints the Israelites make against you and Aaron."
Thus Moses spoke to the Israelites. Their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one from the leader of each of their tribes. Aaron’s staff was among them.
Moses put the staffs in Jehovah’s presence in the tent of the testimony.
The next day Moses went into the tent. He found that Aaron’s staff for the tribe of Levi had not only begun to grow, but it had also blossomed and produced ripe almonds.
Moses brought out the staffs from Jehovah’s presence and showed them to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his staff.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Put Aaron’s staff in front of the testimony. Keep it there as a sign to warn any other rebels. Then you will stop their complaints about me, and they will not die."
Moses did exactly what Jehovah commanded him to do.
The Israelites said to Moses: Now we are going to die! We will perish! We are all lost!
Anyone who comes near Jehovah’s tent will die! Are we all going to die?
Jehovah said to Aaron: "You, your sons, and your family will be responsible for any sins against the holy place. You and your sons will also be responsible for any sins you commit when you work as priests.
"Bring the other Levites from your ancestor’s tribe to join you and help you and your sons serve in front of the tent of the words of my promise.
"They are to fulfill their duties to you and their responsibilities for the tent. However they must not have any contact with sacred objects in the Holy Place or with the altar. If they do, both they and you will be put to death.
"They are to work with you and fulfill their responsibilities for all the service in the tent. No unqualified person may work with you.
"You and your sons alone must fulfill the responsibilities for the Holy Place and the altar. That way my anger will not again break out against the people of Israel.
"I chose the other Levites from among the Israelites to help you. They are a gift given to Jehovah to do the necessary work at the tent of meeting.
"Only you and your sons may do the work of priests, everything done at the altar and under the canopy. This is my gift to you: You may serve me as priests. Anyone else who comes near the holy place to do this work must die."
Jehovah said to Aaron: "I have placed you in charge of all the contributions given to me. I have given you and your descendants all the holy gifts from the Israelites as your share. These contributions will be yours from generation to generation.
"That part of the most holy offerings that is not burned belongs to you. It may come from a grain offering, an offering for sin, or a guilt offering. Whatever is brought to me, as a most holy offering will belong to you and your sons.
"Eat it in a most holy place. Any male may eat it. You must consider it holy.
"The contributions that come as gifts taken from the offerings presented by the Israelites are also yours. I give these to you, your sons, and your daughters. They will be yours from generation to generation. Anyone in your household who is clean may eat them.
"I also give you the first of the produce they give Jehovah. It is the best of all the olive oil and the best of the new wine and fresh grain.
"The first of all produce harvested in their land that they bring to Jehovah are yours. Anyone in your household who is clean may eat it.
"Anything in Israel that is claimed by Jehovah is yours.
"Every firstborn male, human or animal that is brought to Jehovah is yours. But you must buy back every firstborn son and the firstborn male of any unclean animal.
"When they are one month old, you must buy them back at the fixed price of two ounces of silver using the standard weight of the holy place.
"You must never buy back a firstborn bull, sheep, or goat. They are holy. Throw the blood from these animals against the altar. Burn the fat as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah.
"The meat is yours, like the breast and the right thigh that are presented.
"I have given you, your sons, and your daughters all the holy contributions which the Israelites offer to Jehovah. These contributions will be yours from generation to generation. It is an everlasting promise of salt in Jehovah’s presence for you and your descendants."
Jehovah said to Aaron: "You will have no land or property of your own as the other Israelites will have. I am your possession and your property among the Israelites.
"I have given the Levites one-tenth of every Israelite’s income. This is in return for the work they do at the tent of meeting.
"The other Israelites must never again come near the tent of meeting. Otherwise, they will suffer the consequences of their sin and die.
"Only the Levites will do the work at the tent of meeting. They are responsible for their own sins. This is a long lasting law for future generations. They will own no property, as the other Israelites will.
"Instead, I will give the Levites what the Israelites contribute to Jehovah, one-tenth of the Israelites’ income. This is why I said about them: They will own no property as the other Israelites do."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Speak to the Levites and say to them: ‘ You will take one-tenth of the Israelites’ income that I am giving you as your property. When you do, you must contribute one-tenth of that income as your contribution to Jehovah.
"‘ Your contribution will be considered to be grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
"‘ You will also contribute one-tenth of your income to Jehovah out of all that you receive from the Israelites’ income. You will give Jehovah’s contribution to the priest Aaron.
"‘ Out of all the gifts you receive, you must contribute the best and holiest parts to Jehovah. ’
"Also tell them: ‘ When you contribute the best part, your contribution will be considered to be produce from the threshing floor or winepress.
"‘ You and your households may eat it anywhere. This is because it is the wages you receive for your work at the tent of meeting.
"‘ When you contribute the best part, you will not suffer the consequences of any sin. You will not be dishonoring the holy offerings given by the Israelites, and you will not die. ’"
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
"This is a requirement of the law Jehovah has commanded: ‘ Tell the Israelites to bring you a red cow that is perfect, with no defects. Also, it must never have worn a yoke.
"‘ Give it to Eleazar the priest. It must be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
"‘ Eleazar the priest will take some of the blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.
"‘ Then the entire cow, the skin, meat, blood, and excrement, will be burned while he watches.
"‘ The priest will take some cedar wood, a hyssop sprig, and some red yarn and throw them onto the burning cow.
"‘ The priest must then wash his clothes and his body. After that, he may go into the camp. But he will be unclean until evening.
"‘ The person who burned the calf must also wash his clothes and his body. He will be unclean until evening.
"‘ A man who is clean will collect the ashes from the cow and put them in a clean place outside the camp. They will be kept by the congregation of Israel and used in the water that takes away uncleanness. The cow is an offering for sin.
"‘ The one who collected the ashes must wash his clothes. He remains unclean until evening. This regulation is valid for all time to come, both for the Israelites and for the foreigners living among them.
"‘ Those who touch a corpse are ritually unclean for seven days.
"‘ They must purify themselves with the water for purification on the third day and on the seventh day. Then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on both the third and the seventh day, they will not be clean.
"‘ Those who touch a corpse and do not purify themselves remain unclean. This is because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile Jehovah’s tent, and they will no longer be considered God’s people.
"‘ Here are your instructions for when a person dies in a tent: Everyone who goes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent will be unclean for seven days.
"‘ Every container without a lid fastened on it is unclean.
"‘ Whoever is outdoors and touches someone who was killed or has died naturally or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave will be unclean for seven days.
"‘ Do this for people who become unclean from touching a dead body. Put some of the ashes from the red cow that was burned as an offering for sin into a container. Then pour fresh water on them.
"‘ A person who is clean will take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and all the people who were in the tent with the dead body. He must also sprinkle any person who has touched a human bone or a grave and any person who has touched someone who has been killed or who has died naturally.
"‘ A person who is clean will sprinkle these types of unclean people on the third day and the seventh day. On the seventh day the clean person will finish taking away their sins. Then they must wash their clothes and bodies. In the evening they will be clean.
"‘ If the person who becomes unclean does not have his sin taken away, that person must be excluded from the assembly. He has made the holy place of Jehovah unclean. The water to take away uncleanness was not sprinkled on him. He is unclean.
"‘ This will be a long lasting law for them. He who sprinkles the water to take away uncleanness must wash his clothes. He who touches this water will be unclean until evening.
"‘ Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean. The person who touches it will be unclean until evening. ’"
In the first month the whole congregation of Israel came into the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.
The congregation was without water. So they gathered to confront Moses and Aaron.
The people complained to Moses. They said: "If only we had died when the other Israelites died in Jehovah’s presence!
"Did you bring Jehovah’s assembly into this desert just to have us all die and our animals?
"Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us into this terrible place? This is no place to plant crops. Even figs, grapes, and pomegranates will not grow here. And there is no water to drink!"
Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting. They bowed with their faces touching the ground. The glory of Jehovah appeared to them.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Take your staff and you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation. Right before their eyes, tell the rock to give up its water. In this way you will give the congregation water from the rock for them and their animals to drink."
Moses took his staff out of the tent in Jehovah’s presence as he had been commanded.
Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation in front of the rock and said to them: "Listen, you rebels, must we bring water out of this rock for you?"
Moses raised his hand and hit the rock twice with the staff. Water came pouring out! All the people and their animals drank.
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: "You did not trust me! You did not show the Israelites how holy I am! So you will not bring this congregation into the land I am giving them."
This was the oasis of Meribah Complaining, where the Israelites complained about Jehovah and where he showed them he was holy.
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. He said: "This is what your brother Israel says: ‘ You know all the hardships we have had.
"‘ Our ancestors went to Egypt. We lived there for many years. The Egyptians mistreated our ancestors and us.
"‘ We cried to Jehovah for help. He heard our cry and sent an angel, who led us out of Egypt. Now we are at Kadesh, a town at the border of your territory.
"‘ Please permit us to pass through your land. We, including our cattle, will not leave the road or go into your fields or vineyards. We will not drink from your wells. We will stay on the main king’s road until we are out of your territory. ’"
But the Edomites answered: "We refuse to let you pass through our country! If you try, we will march out and attack you."
The people of Israel said: "We will stay on the main road. If we, or our animals, drink any of your water we will pay for it. All we want is to pass through."
The Edomites repeated: "We refuse!" Then they marched out with a powerful army to attack the people of Israel.
The Edomites would not let the Israelites pass through their territory. So the Israelites turned and went another way.
The whole congregation of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor,
on the border of Edom. There Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron:
"Aaron is not going to enter the land I promised to give to Israel. He is going to die, because the two of you rebelled against my command at Meribah.
"Take Aaron and his son Eleazar to Mount Hor.
"Remove Aaron’s priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. Aaron is going to die there."
Moses did what Jehovah commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the entire congregation.
Moses removed Aaron’s priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. There on the top of the mountain Aaron died, and Moses and Eleazar came back down.
The entire congregation learned that Aaron had died. They all mourned for him for thirty days.
The Canaanite king of Arad in the southern part of Canaan heard that the Israelites were coming by way of Atharim. So he attacked them and captured some of them.
Then the Israelites made a vow to Jehovah: "If you will let us conquer these people, we will unconditionally dedicate them and their cities to you and will destroy them."
Jehovah heard them and helped them conquer the Canaanites. The Israelites completely destroyed them and their cities, and named the place Hormah.
They moved from Mount Hor following the road that goes to the Red Sea. That way they could go around Edom. The people became impatient on the trip
and criticized God and Moses. They said: "Why did you make us leave Egypt only to let us die in the desert? There is no bread or water, and we cannot stand this awful food!"
Jehovah sent poisonous snakes among the people. They bit the people, and many of the Israelites died.
The people came to Moses and said: "We sinned when we criticized Jehovah and you. Pray to Jehovah so that he will take the snakes away from us. So Moses prayed for the people."
Jehovah said to Moses: "Make a snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."
Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole. People looked at the copper snake after they were bitten and lived.
The Israelites moved and set up camp at Oboth.
After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory.
Then they camped in Zered Valley.
They moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the desert that extends into Amorite territory. The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.
That is why The Book of Jehovah’s Battles speaks of the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,
and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab.
From there they went on to a place called Wells, where Jehovah said to Moses: Bring the people together, and I will give them water.
The people of Israel sang this song: "Wells, produce your water; And we will greet it with a song.
"The well dug by princes and by leaders of the people, dug with a royal scepter and with their walking sticks. They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah,
and from there they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites, below the top of Mount Pisgah, looking out over the desert.
"The people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say:
"Let us go through your country. We will not go through any of your fields or vineyards or drink any of the water from your wells. We will stay on the king’s highway until we have passed through your territory."
Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his troops and came out into the desert to attack Israel. When Sihon’s troops came to Jahaz, they fought against Israel.
Israel defeated them in battle and took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River. They stopped at the border of the Ammon because it was fortified.
The Israelites settled in the Amorite towns. They settled in the capital city of Heshbon with its surrounding villages.
King Sihon ruled from Heshbon after defeating the Moabites and taking over their land north of the Arnon River gorge.
That is why the Amorites had written this poem about Heshbon: "Come and rebuild Heshbon, King Sihon’s capital city!
"His armies marched out like fiery flames, burning down the town of Ar and destroying the hills along the Arnon River.
"You Moabites are done for! Your god Chemosh deserted your people. They were captured, taken away by King Sihon the Amorite.
"We completely defeated Moab. The towns of Heshbon and Dibon, of Nophah and Medeba are ruined and gone."
After the Israelites settled in the Amorite territory,
Moses sent some men to explore the town of Jazer. Some time later, the Israelites captured the villages surrounding it and forced out the Amorites who lived there.
They turned around and went by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people for battle at Edrei.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Do not fear him for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land. You will do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
The Israelites defeated him, his sons, and all his troops, leaving no survivors. They took possession of his land.
The Israelites moved and set up camp across from Jericho. They were on the plains of Moab east of the Jordan River.
Balak, son of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
The Moabites were very afraid because there were so many Israelites. Also, the Moabites did not like these people.
So the Moabites said to the leaders of Midian: "All those people will eventually eat up everything around us the same way cattle eat up the grass in a field. At that time Balak, son of Zippor, was king of Moab."
He sent messengers to summon Balaam, son of Beor, who was at Pethor, on the Euphrates River, in the land where his people lived. Balak’s message was: "A nation has just come here from Egypt. They have spread out all over the countryside and are setting up their camp here in front of me.
"They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then maybe we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse."
The elders of Moab and Midian left. They took money with them to pay for Balaam’s services. They came to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.
"Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will report to you what Jehovah tells me." So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
God came to Balaam and asked: "Who are these men with you?"
Balaam answered: "Balak, son of King Zippor of Moab, sent them with this message:
"Some people came from Egypt and are spreading out all over the countryside. Now come and curse them for me. Maybe I will be able to fight them and force them out."
God said to Balaam: "Do not go with them! Do not curse these people. They are blessed!"
When Balaam got up in the morning, he said to Balak’s princes: "Go back to your own country. Jehovah has refused to let me go with you."
The Moabite princes went back to Balak and said: "Balaam refused to come with us."
Balak sent a larger group of more highly respected princes.
When they came to Balaam they said to him: "This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘ Do not let anything keep you from coming to me.
"‘ I will make sure you are richly rewarded. I will do whatever you ask. Please, come and curse execrate these people for me. ’"
Balaam answered Balak’s servants: "Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not disobey the command of Jehovah my God no matter whether the request was important or not.
"Now, please stay here tonight, as the others did, and I will find out what else Jehovah may have to tell me."
That night God came to Balaam and said: "If these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you."
Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and left with the Moabite princes.
God became angry that he was going. So the angel of Jehovah stood in the road to stop him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants.
The donkey saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the road with his sword drawn. The donkey turned off the road into a field. Balaam hit the donkey to get it back on the road.
Where the road went through the vineyards, it was narrow, with stonewalls on both sides. Now the angel of Jehovah stood there.
The donkey saw the angel and it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against it. Again Balaam beat the donkey.
Once more the angel moved ahead. He stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side.
This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick.
Jehovah gave the donkey the power of speech. The donkey said to Balaam: "What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?"
Balaam answered: "It is because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you."
The donkey replied: "Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?" "No," he answered.
Then Jehovah let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword. Balaam threw himself face down on the ground.
The angel demanded: "Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey.
"But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it had not, I would have killed you and spared the donkey."
Balaam replied: "I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you think it is wrong for me to go on I will return home."
But the angel said: "Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say." Thus Balaam went on with them.
Balak heard that Balaam was coming. He went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab.
Balak said to him: "Why did you not come when I sent for you the first time? Did you think I was not able to reward you enough?"
Balaam answered: "I am here now. But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say."
Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth.
Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.
The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel.
He said to Balak: "Build seven altars here for me. Then bring me seven bulls and seven rams."
Balak did as he was told. He and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Then Balaam said to Balak: "Stand here by your burnt offering. I will go to see whether or not Jehovah will meet me. I will tell you what he reveals to me." So he went alone to the top of a hill.
God met him and Balaam said to God: "I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each."
Jehovah told Balaam: "Go back to Balak and give him my message."
He went back to Balak and found him standing beside his burnt offering with all the princes of Moab.
Balaam delivered this message: "Balak brought me from Aram. The king of Moab summoned me from the eastern mountains. Come and curse Jacob for me," he said. ‘ Come and condemn Israel.
"‘ How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I condemn those whom Jehovah has not condemned?
"‘ I see them from the top of rocky cliffs. I look at them from the hills. I see a nation that lives by itself! These are people who do not consider themselves to be like other nations.
"‘ The descendants of Jacob are like specks of dust. Who can count them or number even one-fourth of the people of Israel? Let me die the death of innocent people. Let my end be like theirs. ’"
Balak responded to Balaam: "What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but all you have done is bless them!"
Balaam answered: "I must say what Jehovah tells me to say."
Balak said: "Please come with me to another place, where you can see the Israelites. You will see only some of them, not all of them. Curse them for me from there."
So he took him to the Field of Zophim on top of Mount Pisgah. He built seven altars there. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Then Balaam said to Balak: "Stay here beside your burnt offering while I meet with God over there."
Jehovah met Balaam and told him what to say. He sent him back to Balak to give him his message.
So he returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering. He was with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked what Jehovah said.
Balaam uttered this prophecy: "Come, Balak son of Zippor, and listen to what I have to say.
"God is a not man that he should lie. He is not a son of man who changes his mind. Does he ever promise and not fulfill? Does he ever speak and not act?
"I have been instructed to bless. And when God blesses, I cannot call it back.
"He has not observed wickedness in Jacob. Nor has he seen trouble in Israel! Jehovah his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them.
"God brings them out of Egypt. He is for them like the horns of the wild bull.
"For there is omen spell against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel. At the proper time it will be said to Jacob and Israel: What God has done!
"Behold, the nation of Israel! It is like a mighty lion: It will rise and not lie down again until it has torn and devoured it’s pray. It will drink the blood of those it has killed."
Balak said to Balaam: "You refuse to curse malign the people of Israel, but at least do not bless them!"
Balaam answered: "Did I not tell you that I must do everything Jehovah tells me?"
Balak replied: "Come with me. I will take you to another place. Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there."
So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert.
Balaam said to him: "Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams."
Balak did as he was told. He offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Balaam knew that Jehovah wanted him to bless the people of Israel. So he did not go to look for omens, as he had done before. He turned toward the desert.
There he saw the people of Israel camped tribe by tribe. The Spirit of God took control of him.
He uttered this prophecy: The message of Balaam son of Beor. These are the words of the man who can see clearly.
The oracle of him who hears the words of God and who sees the vision of the Almighty. Falling down, yet having his eyes open.
How good are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel!
"They are like valleys that stretch out, like gardens beside the river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, like cedars beside the waters.
"Water will flow from his buckets and his seed will be by many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. And his kingdom shall be exalted.
"God brings him out of Egypt. He is for him like the horns of the wild bull. He will devour the nations who are his adversaries. He will crush their bones in pieces and shatter them with his arrows.
"He bows down and he lies down like a lion. Like a lion, who dares rouse him? Blessed is everyone who blesses you! Cursed is everyone who curses you!"
Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and Balak said to Balaam: I called you to curse my enemies! But you have persisted in blessing them three times!
Therefore, run away to your place now. I said: "I will honor you greatly, but Jehovah has held you back from honor."
Balaam replied to Balak: "Did I not tell the messengers whom you sent to me:
"Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything contrary to the command of Jehovah either good or bad, of my own accord. What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak!
"Now I am going to my people. Come along and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come."
He began his discourse by saying: "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor. The oracle of the man, whose eye is opened,
"The oracle of him who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and sees the vision of the Almighty. Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered.
"I see him, but not now! I behold him, but not near! A star shall come forth from Jacob. A scepter shall rise from Israel and shall crush through the forehead of Moab. It will tear down all the sons of Sheth.
"Edom shall be a possession. Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession. This while Israel performs valiantly.
"One from Jacob will have dominion and will destroy the remnant from the city."
He looked at Amalek and continued his discourse. He said: Amalek was the first of the nations but he will end in destruction.
And he looked at the Kenite and continued his discourse. He said: "Your dwelling place is enduring and your nest is set in the cliff.
"Nevertheless Kain will be consumed! How long will Asshur keep you captive?"
He again offered his discourse and said: "Alas, who can live except God ordain it?
"Ships will come from the coast of Kittim. They will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber. They will also come to destruction."
Balaam got up and went back home. Balak also went his way.
While Israel remained at Shittim, the people indulged in sexual immorality with the Moabite women.
The Moabites invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods.
So Israel joined itself to Baal of Peor. Jehovah was angry against Israel.
Jehovah said to Moses: "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before Jehovah so that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel."
Moses said to the judges of Israel: "Each of you put to death those men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor."
One of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman to his brothers. He did this right in front of Moses and the entire congregation of Israel while they were crying at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron, saw this. He left the assembly and grabbed a spear in his hand.
He went into the tent after the Israelite man. He drove the spear through the man and into the woman’s body. Because of this, the plague that the Israelites were experiencing stopped.
Twenty-four thousand people died from that plague.
Jehovah continued speaking to Moses:
Jehovah said to Moses: "Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of the priest Aaron, turned my fury away from the Israelites. Since he stood up for me, I did not have to stand up for myself and destroy them.
"Tell Phinehas that I now make a promise of peace to him.
"My promise is that he and his descendants will be priests for a very long time because he stood up for his God. He made peace with Jehovah for the Israelites."
The name of the Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri, son of Salu. Salu was the leader of a family from Simeon.
The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi, daughter of Zur. Zur was the head of a family from the Midianite tribes.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Treat the Midianites as your enemies, and kill them!
"This is because they treated you as enemies. They plotted to trick you in the incident that took place at Peor. They used their sister Cozbi, daughter of a Midianite leader, who was killed on the day of the plague caused by the incident at Peor."
After the plague Jehovah said to Moses and Eleazar son of the priest Aaron:
"Take a census of the entire congregation of Israel by households. List those who are at least twenty years old and eligible for military duty."
Moses and the priest Eleazar spoke to the Israelites on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho. They said:
Reuben was Israel’s firstborn. The descendants of Reuben were the family of Hanoch, the family of Pallu,
the family of Hezron, and the family of Carmi.
These were the families of Reuben. The total number of men was forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.
Eliab was the son of Pallu,
and Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram were the sons of Eliab. It was Dathan and Abiram, men chosen by the community, who defied Moses and Aaron’s authority. They joined Korah’s followers when they defied Jehovah’s authority.
The ground opened up and swallowed them along with Korah. They and their followers died when the fire consumed the two hundred and fifty men. This was a warning.
The descendants of Korah did not die.
The families descended from Simeon were the family of Nemuel, the family of Jamin, the family of Jakin,
the family of Zerah, and the family of Shaul.
These were the families of Simeon. The total number of men was twenty-two thousand two hundred.
The families descended from Gad were the family of Zephon, the family of Haggi, the family of Shuni,
the family of Ozni, the family of Eri,
the family of Arodi, and the family of Areli.
These were the families of Gad’s descendants. The total number of men was forty thousand five hundred.
Er and Onan were sons of Judah, but they died in Canaan.
These were the families of Judah. The total number of men was seventy-six thousand five hundred.
The families descended from Issachar were the family of Tola, the family of Puah,
the family of Jashub, and the family of Shimron.
These were the families of Issachar. The total number of men was sixty-four thousand three hundred.
The families descended from Zebulun were the family of Sered, the family of Elon, and the family of Jahleel.
These were the families of Zebulun. The total number of men was sixty thousand five hundred.
The families descended from Joseph through Manasseh and Ephraim were
from Manasseh the family of Machir who was the father of Gilead and the family of Gilead.
The descendants of Gilead were the family of Iezer, the family of Helek,
the family of Asriel, the family of Shechem,
the family of Shemida, and the family of Hepher.
Zelophehad, son of Hepher, had no sons-only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
These were the families of Manasseh. The total number of men was fifty-two thousand seven hundred.
The families descended from Ephraim were the family of Shuthelah, the family of Beker, and the family of Tahan.
The descendants of Shuthelah were the family of Eran.
These were the families of Ephraim’s descendants. The total number of men was thirty-two thousand five hundred. These were the families descended from Joseph.
The families descended from Benjamin were the family of Bela, the family of Ashbel, the family of Ahiram,
the family of Shupham, and the family of Hupham.
The descendants of Bela through Ard and Naaman were the family of Ard and the family of Naaman.
These were the families descended from Benjamin. The total number of men was forty-five thousand six hundred.
The family descended from Dan was the family of Shuham. This was the family descended from Dan.
The total number of men in all the family of Shuham was sixty-four thousand four hundred.
The families descended from Asher were the family of Imnah, the family of Ishvi, and the family of Beriah.
The descendants of Beriah were the family of Heber and the family of Malchiel.
Asher had a daughter named Serah.
These were the families of Asher’s descendants. The total number of men was fifty-three thousand four hundred.
The families descended from Naphtali were the family of Jahzeel, the family of Guni,
the family of Jezer, and the family of Shillem.
These were the families of Naphtali. The total number of men was forty-five thousand four hundred.
The total number of Israelite men was six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Use the list of names from the census to divide the land these people will possess.
"Give more land to larger tribes and less land to smaller ones. Use the totals from the census in giving land to each tribe.
The families descended from Levi were listed as the family of Gershon, the family of Kohath, and the family of Merari.
These were the families of Levi: the Libnite family, the Hebronite family, the Mahlite family, the Mushite family, and the Korahite family. Kohath was the ancestor of Amram.
The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born in Egypt. She gave birth to Amram’s children: Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.
Aaron was the father of Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Nadab and Abihu died because they offered unauthorized fire in Jehovah’s presence.
The total number of all the Levite males at least one month old was twenty-three thousand. They were not counted along with the other Israelites, because they were given no land of their own.
Moses and the priest Eleazar added up the total number of Israelites on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Not a single one of the Israelites Moses and the priest Aaron had counted in the Desert of Sinai were there.
Jehovah said: "They must all die in the desert wilderness." The only ones left were Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
Zelophehad, son of Hepher, grandson of Gilead, descendant of Machir, whose father was Manasseh, belonged to the families of Manasseh, son of Joseph. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
They came to Moses and stood in front of him, the priest Eleazar, the leaders, and the entire congregation at the entrance to the tent of meeting. They said:
"Our father died in the desert. He was not a part of Korah’s followers who joined forces against Jehovah. He died for his own sin and left no sons.
"Why should our father’s name be allowed to die out in his family because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives."
So Moses brought their case to Jehovah.
Jehovah said to him:
"Zelophehad’s daughters are right. You must give them property of their own among their father’s relatives. Turn their father’s property over to them.
"Tell the Israelites: ‘ If a man dies and leaves no sons, turn his property over to his daughters.
"‘ If he has no daughters give his property to his brothers.
"‘ If he has no brothers give his property to his uncles on his father’s side of the family.
"‘ If he has no uncles, give his property to the nearest relative in his family. That relative will take possession of it. This will be a rule for the Israelites, as Jehovah commanded Moses. ’"
Jehovah said to Moses: "Go up into the Abarim Mountains, and take a look at the land I will give the Israelites.
"After you see it, you, too, will join your ancestors in death, as your brother Aaron did.
"You both rebelled against my command in the Desert of Zin. You did not show the people how holy I am when they were complaining at the oasis. "This was the oasis of Meribah at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin.
Moses prayed:
"O Jehovah our God, source of all life, appoint, I pray, a man who can lead the people
and can command them in battle. Do not allow your congregation to be like sheep without a shepherd."
Jehovah said to Moses: "Take Joshua son of Nun, a capable man, and place your hands on his head.
"Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the entire congregation, and there before them all proclaim him as your successor.
"Give him some of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him.
"He will depend on Eleazar the priest, who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim. In this way Eleazar will direct Joshua and the whole congregation of Israel in all their affairs."
Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. He had Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation.
Moses put his hands on Joshua’s head and proclaimed him as his successor, just as Jehovah proclaimed.
Jehovah commanded Moses:
"Instruct the Israelites to present to God at the appointed time the required food offerings that are pleasing to him.
"‘ These are the food offerings that are to be presented to Jehovah: for the daily burnt offering, two one-year-old male lambs without any defects.
"‘ Offer the first lamb in the morning, and the second in the evening,
each with a grain offering of two pounds of flour, mixed with two pints of the best olive oil.
"‘ This is the daily offering that is completely burned. It was first offered at Mount Sinai as a food offering, an odor pleasing to Jehovah.
"‘ As the wine offering with the first lamb, pour out at the altar two pints of wine.
"‘ Offer the second lamb in the evening in the same way as the morning offering, together with its wine offering. It also is a food offering, an odor pleasing to Jehovah.
"‘ On the Sabbath day offer two one-year-old male lambs without any defects, four pounds of flour mixed with olive oil as a grain offering, and the wine offering.
"‘ This burnt offering is to be offered every Sabbath in addition to the daily offering with its wine offering.
"‘ At the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt offering to Jehovah: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without defect.
"‘ With each bull there will be a grain offering of twenty-four cups of flour mixed with olive oil, with each ram a grain offering of sixteen cups of flour mixed with olive oil.
"‘ With each one-year-old lamb a grain offering of eight cups of flour mixed with olive oil. This is a burnt offering, a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
"‘ The wine offering that goes with each bull will be two quarts of wine, with each ram one and one half quarts of wine, and with each lamb one quart of wine. This will be the monthly burnt offering for every month of the year.
"‘ In addition to the daily burnt offering with its wine offering, one male goat must be offered to Jehovah as an offering for sin.
"‘ Jehovah’s Passover is the fourteenth day of the first month.
"‘ The feast of unleavened bread in the fifteenth of this same month. For seven days you must eat only unleavened bread.
"‘ There will be a holy assembly on the first day. Do not do any regular work.
"‘ Instead, bring Jehovah an offering by fire, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven one-year-old lambs, all of them without defects.
"‘ In addition to them bring grain offerings of flour mixed with olive oil. Bring twenty-four cups for each bull, sixteen cups for each ram,
and eight cups for each of the seven lambs.
"‘ Also bring one male goat as an offering for sin to pay compensation for wrongdoing and make peace with Jehovah.
"‘ Offer these in addition to the morning burnt offering.
"‘ Bring all these offerings on each of the seven days. They are food. They are offerings by fire, a soothing aroma to Jehovah. They will be offered in addition to the daily burnt offering and the wine offering that goes with it.
"‘ On the seventh day you must have a holy assembly. You must not do any regular work.
"‘ During the Festival of Weeks, you must have a holy assembly. On that day you must not do any regular work. Bring Jehovah your new grain offering, the first produce harvested from your fields.
"‘ Offer a burnt offering as an odor pleasing to Jehovah: two young bulls, one ram, and seven one-year-old male lambs, all without any defects.
"‘ Offer the proper grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil: six pounds with each bull, four pounds with the ram,
and two pounds with each lamb.
"‘ Offer one male goat as a sin offering. In this way perform the ritual of purification for the people.

Moses told the Israelites everything Jehovah had commanded him.
Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: This is what Jehovah has commanded about vows:
"If a man makes a vow to Jehovah that he will do something or swears an oath that he will not do something, he must not break his word. He must do everything he said he would do.
"A young girl, who still lives in her father’s house, might make a vow to Jehovah that she will do something or swear an oath that she will not do something.
"She must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it.
"If her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. Jehovah will forgive her, because her father refused to let her keep it.
"If an unmarried woman makes a vow, whether deliberately or carelessly, or promises to abstain from something, and then marries,
she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it.
"If her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. Jehovah will forgive her.
"A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something.
"If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something,
her husband may hear about it but may say nothing and not object. Then her vow or oath must be kept.
"But if her husband cancels it when he hears about it, nothing she said in her vow or oath has to be kept. Her husband has canceled it. Jehovah will free her from this vow or oath.
"A husband decides whether or not his wife has to keep any vow to do something or any oath to do without something.
"If he says nothing to her about it day after day, this means he decided that she must keep her vow or oath. She must keep it because he said nothing to her when he heard about it.
"If he cancels it later, he will suffer the consequences."
These are the laws Jehovah gave Moses for husbands and wives, and for fathers with young daughters still living at home.
Jehovah said to Moses:
"Get even with the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites. After that you will join your ancestors in death."
Moses said to the people: "Your men must get ready to go to war against the Midianites. Jehovah will use them to get even with Midian.
"Send one thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel."
Thus one thousand men from each tribe were supplied from the divisions of Israel, twelve thousand men ready for war.
Moses sent them off to war. There were one thousand men from each tribe along with Phinehas, son of the priest Eleazar. Phinehas took with him the holy articles and the trumpets for the fanfare.
They went to war against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses, and killed every man.
Included in those killed were the five kings of Midian-Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam, son of Beor, in battle.
The Israelites took the Midianite women and children as prisoners of war. They also took all their animals, their livestock, and their valuables as loot.
They burned the cities where the Midianites lived and all their settlements.
They took everything as loot including all the people and animals,
and brought the prisoners of war, the loot, and everything to Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Moses, the priest Eleazar, and all the leaders of the congregation went outside the camp to meet them.
Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of the companies and battalions, who were returning from battle.
Moses asked them: "Have you spared all the women?
"Look, these women caused the Israelites, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor. Thus the congregation of Jehovah experienced the plague.
"So kill all the Midianite boys and every Midianite woman who has gone to bed with a man.
"But keep alive for yourselves every girl who has never gone to bed with a man.
"Everyone who killed a person or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp seven days. You and your prisoners of war must use the ritual water on the third and seventh days in order to take away your sin.
"You must do the same for all the clothes and everything made of leather, goats’ hair, or wood."
Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle: "This is what Jehovah’s Law told Moses to do:
"Only the gold and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin and the lead,
"You must wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean. After that you may enter the camp."
Jehovah spoke to Moses:
"You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the families of the congregation take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal.
"Divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and the entire congregation.
"Levy a tax for Jehovah from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep.
"Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to Jehovah.
"From the sons of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah."
Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah commanded Moses.
The booty that remained from the spoil the men of war had plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,
The half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred.
Moses gave the levy that was Jehovah’s offering to Eleazar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And from the Israelites half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war.
Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals from the Israelite’s half. He gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, just as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses.
They said to Moses: "Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing.
"So we brought as an offering to Jehovah what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and ankle bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah."
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of molded articles.
All the gold of the offering they gave to Jehovah, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
Each of the men of war had taken booty.
So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before Jehovah.
The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a large number of livestock. They saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead was indeed a place suitable for livestock.
They approached Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the leaders of the congregation and said:
"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
"Please give us this land as our property. Do not make us cross the Jordan River."
Moses asked the tribes of Gad and Reuben: Are you going to stay here while the rest of the Israelites go to war?
That might discourage them from entering the land Jehovah has given them.
That is what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look at the land.
They went as far as the Eshcol Valley. They saw the land. But then they discouraged the rest of the Israelites from entering the land Jehovah had given them.
That day Jehovah became angry and swore this oath:
"None of the people twenty years old or older, who came from Egypt, will see the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with an oath. This is because they did not wholeheartedly follow me.
"Only Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun will get to see the land. This is because they wholeheartedly followed Jehovah.
"Jehovah’s anger blazed against the Israelites. Therefore he made them wander in the desert for forty years until the whole generation of those who had done evil in Jehovah’s presence was gone.
"You are just like your parents! You are a bunch of sinners trying to make Jehovah angry at Israel again.
"If you turn away from him he will abandon all these people in the desert. You would be responsible for their destruction."
The tribes of Gad and Reuben came to Moses and said: "Allow us to build stone fences for our livestock and cities for our families here.
"Then we will be ready to march in battle formation ahead of the other Israelites until we have brought them to their land. Meanwhile our families will live in walled cities. They will be safe from the other people who live here.
"We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his own land.
"We will not take possession of any land on the other side of the Jordan River, to the west and beyond. We already have our land here, east of the Jordan."
Moses answered: "If you really mean what you say, then here in the presence of Jehovah get ready to go into battle.
"All your fighting men are to cross the Jordan and under Jehovah’s command they are to attack our enemies until Jehovah defeats them
and takes possession of the land. You may return after that, because you will have fulfilled your obligation to Jehovah and to the other Israelites. Then Jehovah will acknowledge that this land east of the Jordan is yours.
"If you do not keep your promise, I warn you that you will be sinning against Jehovah. Do not doubt this, you will be punished for your sin.
"So build your towns and the enclosures for your sheep, but do what you have promised!"
The men from Reuben and Gad answered Moses: "Sir, we will do just what you have said.
"Our wives, children, sheep and cattle will stay here in the towns in Gilead.
"However those of us prepared for battle will cross the Jordan and fight for Jehovah."
Moses said to Eleazar, Joshua, and the family leaders:
"Make sure the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you. If they do, then after the land is in your control, give them the region of Gilead as their tribal land.
"But if they break their promise, they will receive land on the other side of the Jordan, like the rest of the tribes."
The tribes of Gad and Reuben replied: "We are your servants and will do whatever Jehovah has commanded.
"We will enter Canaan as armed troops in Jehovah’s presence. The land we will take possession of is here, east of the Jordan."
So Moses gave the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph, the kingdoms of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan. It was the whole land with its cities and its surrounding territory.
The tribe of Gad rebuilt the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran as walled cities. They also built stone fences for their flocks.
The tribe of Reuben rebuilt the cities of Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
Nebo, Baal Meon whose names were changed, and Sibmah. These are the names they gave the cities they rebuilt.
The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead. They captured it and forced out the Amorites who were there.
So Moses gave Gilead to the people of Machir the descendants of Manasseh, and they lived there.
Then Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured the settlements in Gilead. He called them Havvoth Jair.
Nobah captured Kenath and its villages. He named it Nobah after himself.
This is a list of all the places where the Israelites set up camp after they left Egypt in organized groups under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
Jehovah command Moses to wrote down the places where they went as they traveled. This is the list:
They moved from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. The Israelites boldly left in full view of all the Egyptians.
The Egyptians buried all their firstborn sons, whom Jehovah had killed in a mighty act of judgment on their gods.
The Israelites moved from Rameses and set up camp at Succoth.
They moved from Succoth and set up camp on the edge of the desert at Etham.
They moved from Etham and turned back to Pi Hahiroth, east of Baal Zephon. They set up camp near Migdol.
They moved from Pi Hahiroth and went through the middle of the sea into the desert. After they traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham, they set up camp at Marah.
From there they went to Elim, where they camped. There were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees there.
They left Elim and camped near the Gulf of Suez.
Their next camp was in the desert of Zin.
Then the Israelites camped at Dophkah,
and after that at Alush.
Next was Rephidim, where there was no water for them to drink.
They moved from Rephidim and set up camp in the Desert of Sinai.
Jehovah commanded Aaron the priest to go up on Mount Hor. He died there on the first day of the fifth month in the fortieth year after the Israelites left Egypt.
The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.
They moved from Mount Hor and set up camp at Zalmonah.
Jehovah said to Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho,
Tell the Israelites: "You will cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan.
"As you advance, force out all the people who live there. Get rid of all their stone and metal idols, and destroy all their places of worship.
"Take possession of the land and live there. I will give it to you for your own.
Divide the land among your families by drawing lots. Give more land to larger families and less land to smaller ones. The land must be given to each family by drawing lots. Divide it among your ancestors’ tribes.
"If you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those that are left will be as troublesome as splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will fight against you.
"If you do not drive them out, I will destroy you, as I planned to destroy them."
Jehovah gave Moses
the following instructions for the people of Israel: "When you enter Canaan, the land I am giving you, these are the borders of your territory.
"The southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. It will begin on the east at the southern end of the Dead Sea.
"It will turn southward toward Akrabbim Pass and continue on through Zin as far south as Kadesh Barnea. It will turn northwest to Hazar Addar and on to Azmon,
where it will turn toward the valley at the border of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean.
"The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea, it will be the western border.
"The northern border will follow a line from the Mediterranean to Mount Hor
and from there to Hamath Pass. It will continue to Zedad
and to Ziphron, and will end at Hazar Enan.
"The eastern border will follow a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
"It will then go south to Harbel, east of Ain, and on to the hills on the eastern shore of Lake Galilee,
then south along the Jordan River to the Dead Sea. These will be the four borders of your land."
Moses said to the Israelites: "This is the land you will receive by drawing lots. This is the land that Jehovah has assigned to the nine and one-half tribes.
"The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half of Manasseh have received their property, divided according to their families,
on the eastern side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho."
Jehovah said to Moses:
"These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you: the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun.
"You must also take one leader from each tribe to divide the land.
These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah,
Jehovah commanded these men to divide Canaan for the Israelites.
Jehovah spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho. He said:
"Tell the Israelites to give the Levites some cities from their own property. They must also give the Levites the pastureland around those cities.
"The Levites will have cities to live in and pastureland for their cattle, the flocks they own, and any other animals they have.
"The land around the cities that you give the Levites will extend fifteen hundred feet from the city wall.
"Outside the city measure off three thousand feet on the east side, three thousand feet on the south side, three thousand feet on the west side, and three thousand feet on the north side, with the city in the center. This will be their pastureland around the city.
"Six of the cities you give the Levites will be cities of refuge. You must allow murderers to escape to these cities. In addition, you must also give the Levites forty-two other cities.
"You will give a total of forty-eight cities with pastureland to the Levites.
"The cities you give the Levites from the property of the other Israelites must be given based on the amount of land each tribe owns. Take more cities from larger tribes and fewer from smaller tribes."
Jehovah continued to speak to Moses:
"Tell the Israelites: When you cross the Jordan River and enter Canaan,
select certain cities to be places of refuge. Anyone who unintentionally kills another person may run to them.
"These cities will be places of refuge from any relative who can avenge the death. So anyone accused of murder will not have to die until he has had a trial in front of the community.
"There will be six cities you select as places of refuge.
"Three will be on the east side of the Jordan River and three in Canaan.
"These six cities will be places of refuge for Israelites, foreigners, and strangers among you. Anyone who unintentionally kills another person may flee to these cities.
"If any of you uses an iron weapon to kill another person, you are a murderer. Murderers must be put to death.
"The relative who can avenge the death must make sure a murderer is put to death. When he catches up with the murderer, he must kill him.
"If any of you kills someone you hate by shoving him or by deliberately throwing something at him,
or if you beat your enemy to death with your bare hands, you must be put to death. You are a murderer. The relative who can avenge the death must kill you when he catches up with you, because you are a murderer.
"Should you accidentally kill someone who was not your enemy. Maybe you shoved him or threw something at him but did not mean to kill him.
"Or if you drop a big stone, and someone is killed. However, you did not know the person was there, he was not your enemy, and you were not trying to harm him.
"Then the community must use these rules in order to decide if you are innocent or if the dead person’s relative can avenge the death.
"If you are innocent, the community must protect you from that relative. They must take you back to the city of refuge you fled to. You must live there until the death of the chief priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
"But do not go outside the city of refuge you fled to.
"If the relative who can avenge the death finds you outside the city of refuge and kills you, the relative is not guilty of murder.
"Accused murderers must stay in their city of refuge until the death of the chief priest. They may go back to their own property only after his death.
"These rules apply to you and your descendants wherever you may live.
"Those accused of murder may be found guilty and put to death only on the evidence of two or more witnesses. The evidence of one witness is not sufficient to support an accusation of murder.
"Murderers must be put to death. They cannot escape this penalty by the payment of money.
"If they have fled to a city of refuge, do not allow them to make a payment in order to return home before the death of the High Priest.
"If you did this, you would defile the land where you are living. Murder defiles the land, and except by the death of the murderer there is no way to perform the ritual of purification for the land where someone has been murdered.
"Do not defile the land where you are living! I am Jehovah and I live among the people of Israel."
The heads of the families in the clan of Gilead the son of Machir and grandson of Manasseh son of Joseph, went to Moses and the other leaders.
They said: "Jehovah commanded you to distribute the land to the people of Israel by drawing lots. He also commanded you to give the property of our relative Zelophehad to his daughters.
"Remember, if they marry men of another tribe, their property will then belong to that tribe, and the total allotted to us will be reduced.
"During the Year of Restoration, when all property that has been sold is restored to its original owners, the property of Zelophehad’s daughters will be permanently added to the tribe into which they marry and will be lost to our tribe."
So Moses gave the people of Israel the following command from Jehovah. He said: "What the tribe of Manasseh says is right,
and so Jehovah says that the daughters of Zelophehad are free to marry anyone they wish but only within their own tribe.
"The property of every Israelite will remain attached to his tribe.
"Every woman who inherits property in an Israelite tribe must marry a man belonging to that tribe. In this way all Israelites will inherit the property of their ancestors,
and the property will not pass from one tribe to another. Each tribe will continue to possess its own property."
Zelophehad’s daughters did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
They married within the families of the descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph. So their land stayed in the tribe of their father’s family.
These are the commandments and rules Jehovah gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River across from Jericho.
These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel. He was on this side of the Jordan in the desert wilderness, in the plain near the Red Sea Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
It is only an eleven-day journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
It was the fortieth year, eleventh month, on the first day of the month. Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all the commandments Jehovah gave him for them.
After he killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived at Astaroth in Edrei:
On this side east of Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses declared the Law. He said:
"Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb. He said: ‘ You have lived long enough on this mountain.
"Leave this place and go to the mountain of the Amorites, and all the places near there in the plain, in the hills, and in the valley and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.
"I have given you this land. Go in and possess the land Jehovah pledged to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and to their descendants offspring after them. ’
"I spoke to you then and said: ‘ I am not able to bear the burden of you alone.
"‘ Jehovah your God has increased your numbers. Today you are more numerous than the stars of heaven.
"‘ Jehovah the God of your fathers will make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he promised you!
"‘ How can I alone bear your encumbrance, your burden, and your strife?
"‘ Take wise men with understanding, who are known among your tribes. I will make them rulers over you. ’
"You answered me: ‘ The thing you speak is good for us to do. ’
"So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men and known, and made them rulers over you. I made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
"I charged your judges to hear the cases between your countrymen and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger with him.
"You will not show partiality in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great. You will not fear man for the judgment is God's. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it. ’
I commanded you at that time all the things you should do.
"When we left Horeb, we went through that entire great and terrible wilderness. You saw it by way of the mountain of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us. We went to Kadesh-barnea.
"I said to you: ‘ You have arrived at the mountain of the Amorites. Jehovah gives this mountain to us.
"Every one of you came near to me and said: ‘ We will send men before us. They will search the land. They will bring us word about the way we must go and what cities are there. ’
What you said pleased me very much. I took twelve of your men, one from each tribe.
They went up to the mountain to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it.
They picked the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us. They brought us word again. They said: ‘ It is a good land that Jehovah our God gives us. ’
Even so they were not willing to go. They rebelled against the command of Jehovah your God:
"You complained in your tents, and said: Jehovah hates us so he brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
"‘ Where can we go up? Our brothers caused us to lose heart. They said: The people are stronger and taller than we are. The cities are large and the walls go up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there." ’
"I said to you: ‘ Do not be afraid of them.
"‘ Jehovah your God leads you. He will fight for you just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes!
"‘ You saw how Jehovah your God carried you like a father carries his son all the way until you reached this place. ’
"Yet in all this you did not trust Jehovah your God.
"He went ahead of you to find places for you to camp. He offered fire by night and cloud by day to show you the way you should go.
"Jehovah heard what you said. He was angry and solemnly swore:
"‘ Not one man of this evil generation will see that good land, which I swore to give your fathers,
"‘ Except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it. I will give him and his descendants the land he walks on. This is because he followed Jehovah wholeheartedly.
"‘ Jehovah was angry with me because of you. He said to me: ‘ You will also not go there.
"‘ Your assistant Joshua son of Nun will go there. He will lead the people into the land. Encourage him to go there.
"‘ The little ones that you said would be taken captive will enter the land. Your children who do not know good from bad will go in. I will give it to them and they will possess it.
"‘ But you must turn around and go back through the desert toward the Red Sea. ’
"You answered: ‘ We have sinned against Jehovah. We will fight just as Jehovah our God commanded us. ’ ’ When every man puts on his armor and weapons of war they will be ready to go to the mountain.
"‘ But Jehovah said to me: ‘ Tell them, do not go and fight! I am not with you. Your enemies will defeat you." ’
I told you, but you would not listen. You disobeyed Jehovah’s command and proudly invaded the mountainous region.
The Amorites who lived there came out and attacked you. They chased you like a swarm of bees. They defeated you! They drove you back from Seir all the way to Hormah.
You returned and cried to Jehovah. Jehovah, however, did not listen to you. He turned a deaf ear to you!
That is why you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did.
"We went back into the desert. We followed the road that leads to the Red Sea as Jehovah told me. For a long time we traveled around the region of Mount Seir.
"Then Jehovah said to me:
‘ You traveled around this mountain long enough. Now go north.
"‘ Give these instructions to the people: "You will pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They live in Seir. They will be afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully.
"‘ Do not start a fight with them, because I am not giving you any of their land, not so much as one foot. I gave Esau's descendants the region of Mount Seir as their property.
"‘ You must pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.
"‘ Remember how Jehovah your God blessed you in everything you have done. He took care of you as you wandered through this vast desert. He has been with you these forty years. You had everything you needed." ’
We moved on and left the road that goes from the towns of Elath and Eziongeber to the Dead Sea. "We turned northeast toward Moab."
"Then Jehovah said to me: ‘ Do not trouble the people of Moab, the descendants of Lot. And do not start a war with them. I gave them the city of Ar, and I am not going to give you any of their land. ’
The Emits used to live there. They are a mighty race of giants who lived in Ar. They were as tall as the Anakim, another race of giants.
Like the Anakim they were also known as Rephaim; but the Moabites called them Emim.
Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau chased them out. They destroyed their nation and settled there themselves. This is similar to the Israelites who later chased their enemies out of the land that Jehovah gave them.
Then we crossed the Zered River Valley just as Jehovah told us to do.
This was thirty-eight years after we left Kadesh-Barnea. By that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as Jehovah said they would.
Jehovah kept getting rid of them until finally none of them were left.
"When the last of these soldiers died,
"Jehovah said to me Moses:
"‘ You will cross over the border of Moab at Ar today.
"‘ When you come near the Ammonites, do not bother them or start a fight with them. I am not giving you any of the land that I already gave to the descendants of Lot as their property.
"‘ This territory is also known as the land of the Rephaim. That is the name of the giants who formerly lived there. The Ammonites called them Zamzummim.
"They were as tall as the Anakim. There were many of them. They were a mighty race. But Jehovah destroyed them. Then the Ammonites took over their land and settled there.
"Jehovah did the same thing for the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in the mountains of Edom. He destroyed the Horites. That allowed the Edomites to take over their land and settled there, where they still live.
"The Avims lived in Hazerim, even as far as Azzah. The Caphtorims came from Caphtor to destroy them and live there in their place.
Moses continued: "Cross over the Arnon River. I will help you defeat Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon and his country. Possess his land and engage him in battle.
"From this day forward I will make all the people and nations through out the earth afraid of you. They will hear reports about you and tremble and be in anguish because of you.
"I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following offer of peace:
‘ If you allow us to travel through your country, we will go straight through and will not leave the road.
‘ We will pay you in silver for the food we eat and the water we drink. Please let us go through,
as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us. We will keep going until we cross the Jordan River into the land Jehovah our God is giving us. ’
King Sihon of Heshbon would not allow us to pass through. Jehovah your God made him stubborn and overconfident in order to hand him over to you, as he has now done.
"Then Jehovah said to me: ‘ I make King Sihon and his land helpless before you. Capture his land and occupy it. ’
Sihon came out with all his men to fight us near the town of Jahaz,
and Jehovah our God helped us defeat them. We killed Sihon, his sons, and all his people.
We captured and destroyed every town in Sihon's kingdom. We killed everyone.
We took the livestock and everything else of value.
Jehovah helped us capture every town from the Arnon River Gorge north to the boundary of Gilead. This included the town of Aroer on the edge of the gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge.
However, we did not go near the Ammonite towns, both in the mountains and near the Jabbok River, just as Jehovah commanded.
"Next we headed for the land of Bashan. King Og of Bashan and all his army came to fight us at Edrei.
"Jehovah said to me: ‘ Do not be afraid of him. I will hand him, all his army, and his land, over to you. Do to him what you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon. ’
"So Jehovah our God also handed King Og of Bashan and all his army over to us. We defeated him and left no survivors.
"We captured all his cities. Not one was missed. We captured a total of sixty cities in the territory of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
"All of these cities were fortified with high walls and double-door gates with bars across the gates. We also captured a large number of unwalled villages.
"We destroyed all the towns and put to death all the men, women, and children. This was just as we did in the towns that belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon.
"We kept the livestock and took plunder from the towns.
"Sihon and Og ruled Amorite kingdoms east of the Jordan River. Their land stretched from the Arnon River Gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north. We captured it all.
"Mount Hermon is called Mount Sirion by the people of Sidon. The Amorites call it Mount Senir.
"All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, and Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan were captured.
"Of the Rephaim only King Og of Bashan was left. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.
"We took possession of this land. I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land north of Aroer near the Arnon Valley and half of the mountain region of Gilead with its cities.
"I assigned the rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, where Og had ruled, that is, the entire Argob region to half the tribe of Manasseh. Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim.
Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, took the entire region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of Geshur and Maacah. He named the villages after himself, and they are still known as the villages of Jair.
I assigned Gilead to the clan of Machir of the tribe of Manasseh.
"I assigned the territory from Gilead to the Arnon River to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The middle of the river was their southern boundary, and their northern boundary was the Jabbok River, part of which formed the Ammonite border.
"On the west their territory extended to the Jordan River, from Lake Galilee in the north down to the Dead Sea in the south and to the foot of Mount Pisgah on the east.
"Then I gave them the following instructions: ‘ Jehovah our God gave you the land east of the Jordan to occupy. Now arm your fighting men and send them across the Jordan ahead of the other tribes of Israel, to help them occupy their land.
"‘ Your wives, children, and livestock, for you have a lot of livestock, will remain behind in the towns I assigned to you.
"‘ Help the other Israelites until they occupy the land Jehovah is giving them west of the Jordan and until Jehovah lets them live there in peace, just as he has done here for you. After that, you may return to the land I assigned to you. ’
"I also gave Joshua this command: ‘ You have seen with your own eyes everything Jehovah your God has done to these two kings. Jehovah will do the same to all of the kingdoms on the other side of the Jordan River where you are going.
"‘ Do not be afraid of them. For Jehovah your God fights for you. ’
"Then I pleaded with Jehovah:
"‘ O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you have begun to show me how great and powerful you are. What kind of god is there in heaven or on earth that can do the deeds and the mighty acts you have done?
"‘ Please let me go over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan River. Let me see those beautiful mountains in Lebanon. ’
"Jehovah was angry with me because of you, so he would not listen to me. He said: ‘ Enough of that! Do not talk to me anymore about this.
"‘ Go to the top of Mount Pisgah, and look west, north, south, and east. You may look at the land, but you will never cross the Jordan River.
"‘ Joshua will lead Israel across the Jordan to take the land. So help him. Encourage him and strengthen him. Tell him what he must do. ’
So we stayed in the valley at Beth Peor.
"Israel, listen to these laws and teachings! If you obey them you will live! Go in and take the land that Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving you.
"He is your God. I am telling you everything he has commanded. So do not add anything or take anything away.
"You saw how he killed everyone who worshiped the god Baal at Peor.
"But all of you who were faithful to Jehovah your God are still alive today.
"I have taught you laws and rules as Jehovah my God commanded me. You must obey them when you enter the land and take possession of it.
"Carefully obey the laws. For this will show your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations. They will hear all these statutes and say: ‘ Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. ’
"What great nation is there, who has God so near to them? For we call on Jehovah our God for all things!
"And what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments so righteous as the law I present to you this day?
"Be on your guard! Make sure you do not forget, as long as you live, what you have seen with your own eyes. Teach them to your children and your grandchildren.
"Do you remember the day you stood in the presence of Jehovah your God at Mount Sinai Horeb? He said to me: ‘ assemble the people. I want them to hear what I have to say, so that they will learn to obey me as long as they live. Then they will teach their children to do the same. ’
"Tell your children how you went close and stood at the foot of the mountain covered with thick clouds of dark smoke and fire blazing up to the sky.
"Tell them how Jehovah spoke to you from the fire. Tell them that you heard him speak but did not see him in any form at all.
"He told you what you must do to keep the covenant he made with you. You must obey the Ten Commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets.
"Jehovah told me to teach you all the laws that you are to obey in the land that you are about to invade and occupy.
"Be careful! When God spoke to you from the fire, he was invisible.
"Do not commit the sin of worshiping idols. Do not make idols to be worshiped, whether they are shaped like men, women,
animals on the earth, birds that fly in the air,
or they are like reptiles that creep on the ground, or fish from the water.
"Do not be tempted to bow down and worship the sun or moon or stars the host or army of the heavens. Jehovah put them there a heritage for all the people under the heavens.
"But you are Jehovah’s people! He led you through fiery trials and rescued you from Egypt.
"Furthermore, Jehovah was angry with me because of you. So Jehovah your God took an oath that I would not cross the Jordan River and enter the good land he is giving you as your property inheritance possession.
"I am going to die in this land. I will not cross the Jordan River. But you are going to go across and take possession of that good land.
"Take care of yourselves. Do not forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you. Do not make a graven image, or the likeness of anything, which Jehovah your God has forbidden.
"For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire, even a totally demanding zealous God. He requires exclusive devotion!
"When you have children, and grandchildren, and you have remained in the land a long time do not corrupt yourselves. If you make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and do evil in the sight of Jehovah your God, you will provoke him to anger:
"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that you will soon utterly perish from off the land you possess the other side of the Jordan. You will not prolong your days upon it, but will be destroyed.
"Jehovah will scatter you among the nations. You will become few in number among the heathen, where Jehovah will lead you.
"You will serve gods that are the work of men's hands. Made of wood and stone. They cannot see, hear, eat or smell.
"From there you will seek Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your being. And you will find him!
"When you are in trouble distress and all these things happen to you in the latter days, turn to Jehovah your God and obey his voice.
"Jehovah your God is a merciful God. He will not forsake you. He will not destroy you, nor forget the covenant he made with your fathers.
"Ask about the days from the past. A time that came before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth. And ask from one side of heaven to the other whether there has ever been anything like this great thing, or anything like it has been heard?
"Did people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
"Has God attempted to take a nation from the middle of another nation? Has he done this by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by great terrors? Yes, and by the use of his great power! Jehovah your God did all this for you in Egypt before your very eyes!
"This was shown to you that you might know that JEHOVAH IS GOD! THERE IS NO ONE BESIDES HIM!
"He made you hear his voice out of heaven. That way he could instruct teach correct discipline you. He showed you his great fire on the earth. You heard his words from the middle of the fire.
"He loved your fathers. Therefore he chose their descendants. In fact he watched over you and he brought you out of Egypt with his mighty power.
"He drove out nations far greater than you so that he could bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance as it is today.
"Know this and consider it in your heart today: JEHOVAH IS GOD in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: THERE IS NO ONE ELSE!
"You must keep the regulations and commandments I commanded you today. Then all will go well with you and with your children after you. You may prolong your days on the earth that Jehovah your God gives you for all time."
Moses set aside three cities on the east side of the Jordan.
Those who unintentionally killed someone whom they had never hated could flee to one of these cities and save their lives.
The cities were Bezer on the desert plateau for the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh.
Moses gave God's Laws and teachings to the people of Israel.
After they came out of Egypt they were in the valley east of the Jordan River he gave them the laws.
They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the other Amorite king who lived east of the Jordan.
This land extended from the town of Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon River, north to Mount Sirion, that is, Mount Hermon.
It included the region east of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea and east to the foot of Mount Pisgah.
Moses called all the people of Israel, and said: "Hear, O Israel, the regulations and laws I declare to you today. Learn them and obey them!
"Jehovah our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
"Jehovah did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all of us here alive today.
"Jehovah talked with you face to face on the mountain out of the middle of the fire,
"I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to declare to you the word of Jehovah. You were afraid because of the fire. So you would not go up onto the mountain. He said:
"‘ I am Jehovah your God. I brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
"‘ Do not have any other god but me.
"‘ Do not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above, or on the earth below, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:
"‘ Do not bow down to them. Do not serve them! For I Jehovah your God am a totally demanding zealous God. I require exclusive devotion and punish the fathers and children who hate me to the third and fourth generation.
"‘ I show loving kindness to thousands of generations who love me and obey my commandments.
"‘ Do not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain. Jehovah will not leave him unpunished who takes his name in vain.
"‘ Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it keep it holy, as Jehovah your God has commanded you.
"‘ Do all your work in six days.
"‘ The seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah your God: in it you should not do any work. Your son and daughter should not work. Your manservant and maidservant should not work. Your ox, donkey, cattle or any stranger living with you should not work. Your manservant and maidservant should rest as much as you do.
"‘ Remember that you were servants in the land of Egypt, and that Jehovah your God brought you out through a mighty act. Jehovah your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
"‘ Honor your father and your mother, as Jehovah your God commands you and your days will be prolonged and things will go well with you, in the land Jehovah gives you.
"‘ Do not kill.
"‘ Do not commit adultery.
"‘ Do not steal.
"‘ Do not bear false witness against another man.
"‘ Do not desire another man's wife; do not covet another man's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his donkey, or any thing that belongs to him. ’
"Jehovah spoke to us when we gathered on the mountain. He spoke with a loud voice from the dark fiery cloud. Jehovah gave us these words, and only these. Then he wrote them on two flat tablets of stone and gave them to me.
"Fire blazed from the mountain, and you heard the voice coming from the darkness. Then your elders came to me.
"They said: ‘ Today Jehovah our God has shown us how powerful and glorious he is. He spoke to us from the fire. We learned that people could live, even though God speaks to them.
"‘ We do not want to take a chance on being killed by that terrible fire. If we hear Jehovah’s voice again we will die.
"‘ Has any other human ever heard the only true God speaking from fire, as we have? And if they have, would they live to tell about it?
"‘ They spoke to Moses: ‘ Moses, go and listen to everything that Jehovah our God says. Then tell us whatever Jehovah our God tells you. We will listen and obey. ’
"Jehovah heard the words you spoke to me. He told me: ‘ I have heard what the people said to you. Everything they said was good.
If only they had such a heart in them that they would respect reverence me and obey all my commandments for as long as they live! Then things would go well for them and their children from generation to generation. ’
Jehovah continued: "Tell the people to go back to their tents."
But you stay here with me. I will give you all the commands, laws, and rules that you must teach them to obey in the land I will give them to possess.
Be careful to do what Jehovah your God has commanded you. Never turn to the right or to the left.
Follow all the directions Jehovah your God has given you. Then you will continue to live. Life will go well for you! You will live for a long time in the land that you are going to possess.
"These are the commands, decrees and laws Jehovah your God commanded me to teach you. Obey them after you enter the land and take possession of it.
"As long as you live, you, your son, and your grandson must respect Jehovah your God. All of you must obey his laws and commandments I give you. Then you will live a long time.
"Listen, O Israel, and be careful to obey these laws. Things will go well for you and your population will increase in a land flowing with milk and honey. This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestors promised you.
"Listen, Israel! JEHOVAH OUR GOD IS ONE GOD!
"You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with your entire mind and with all your strength.
"These words that I command you this day must be in your heart.
"Carefully teach them to your sons. Talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way. Speak about them when you lie down, and when you rise up.
"Bind them for a sign upon your hand. They shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
"Write them upon the posts of your house, and on your gates.
"It shall be like the time when Jehovah your God brought you into the land he promised to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. He would give you large and beautiful cities that you did not build.
"The houses will be full of good things that you did not put in them. There will be wells that you did not dig. There will be vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant. Jehovah will bring you into this land and you will have all you want to eat.
"Beware that you do not forget Jehovah, for he brought you out of Egypt your house of bondage.
"You must respect Jehovah your God. Serve him and swear by his name!
"Do not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples around you.
"Jehovah your God is a totally demanding zealous God. He tolerates no rivals! The anger of Jehovah your God will burn against you. He will then destroy you from the face of the earth.
"Do not test Jehovah your God like you tested him in Massah.
"Obey the commandments of Jehovah your God. Obey his testimonies and statutes for he commanded you.
"Do what is right and good in Jehovah’s sight. Then you will be able to go in and possess this good land from your enemies, just as he promised your ancestors.
"You will throw out all your enemies as Jehovah said.
"In the future your son will ask you: ‘ What is the meaning of these laws and regulations that Jehovah our God has commanded you? ’
"‘ You will answer your son: ‘ We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
"‘ Jehovah showed signs and wonders before our eyes, great and terrible signs, against Egypt, Pharaoh and his entire household.
"‘ He brought us out from there. That way he could give us the land he swore to give to our fathers.
"‘ Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes. He required that we respect Jehovah our God. This was for our own good that he might preserve us alive, as things are today.
"‘ If we are careful to do these commandments before Jehovah our God, just as he ordered us, it will mean righteousness for us. ’"
"Jehovah your God will bring you into the land you are to possess. He will clear away many nations ahead of you. The nations he will clear: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, Hivites, and the Jebusites. These seven nations are larger and mightier than you.
"Jehovah your God will deliver them to you. You must crush them! Completely destroy them. You should make no covenant with them. Do not show them mercy.
"Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons.
"They will lead your young people away from me to serve other gods. So the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against you and will destroy you suddenly.
"Deal with them in this way: Destroy their altars and break down their sacred pillars. Cut down their idols and burn them with fire.
"You are a holy people to Jehovah your God. Jehovah your God has chosen you to be his own special people out of all the nations of the earth.
"Jehovah set his heart on you. He chose you, even though you did not outnumber all the other people. You were the smallest of all nations.
"You were chosen because Jehovah loved you and kept the oath he swore to your fathers. So he used his mighty hand to bring you out. He freed you from slavery under Pharaoh king of Egypt.
"Keep in mind that Jehovah your God is the only true God. He is the faithful God. He keeps his promise and is merciful to thousands of generations of those who love him and obey his commandments.
"He destroys everyone who hates him. He never takes long to pay back anyone who hates him.
"So obey the commandments, laws, and judgments I give you today.
"If you listen to these rules and faithfully obey them, Jehovah your God will keep his covenant with you and be merciful to you, as he swore to your fathers.
"He will love you, bless you, and increase the number of your descendants. He will bless you with children. He will bless your land with produce: grain, new wine, and olive oil. He will bless your herds with calves, and your flocks with lambs and kids. This will all happen in the land Jehovah will give you, as he swore to your fathers.
"God will bless you more than any other people. There will not be a male or a female barren among you or your livestock.
"Jehovah will take away every sickness from you. He will not afflict you with any of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you have known. He will put them on all who hate you.
"Destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God gives you. Do not look at them with pity. Do not serve their gods. For that would be a snare to you.
"You may say in your heart: These nations are stronger then we are, how can we throw them out of their land?
"Do not be afraid of them. Remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt.
"You saw with your own eyes the terrible plagues, the miraculous signs, and the amazing things Jehovah did. He used his mighty hand and powerful arm to bring you out. He will do the same thing to all the people who frighten you.
"Jehovah your God will send the hornet against them. Those who are left will hide from you and perish.
"Do not be terrified of them. Jehovah your God is with you. He is great and awesome God.
"Jehovah your God will drive out these nations before you little by little. You will not be able to put an end to them quickly. This is because the wild beasts are too numerous and will multiply around you.
"Jehovah your God will deliver them over to you. He will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
"He will deliver their kings into your hand. You will make their name perish from under heaven. They will not be able to stand before you for you will destroy them.
"Burn the carved images of their gods with fire. Do not covet the silver or the gold that is on them. Do not take it for yourselves, or you will be snared by it. It is an abomination to Jehovah your God.
"Do not bring an abomination into your house. You must utterly detest it and you must utterly abhor it, for it is something banned."
"Be careful to do all the commandments I commanded you today! You will then live and multiply and go in and possess the land Jehovah promised to give to your forefathers.
"Remember the forty years Jehovah your God led you in the wilderness. He did this in order to humble you and test you. He wanted to know what was in your heart. Whether you would obey his commandments.
"He humbled you allowed you to suffer with hunger and then fed you with manna. Neither you nor your fathers had seen this before. He did this to teach you that a person cannot live on bread alone but must live on all everything every word that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah.
"Your clothes did not wear out! And your feet did not swell these past forty years.
Learn this lesson by heart: Jehovah your God disciplined you like parents discipline their children.
"Obey the commandments of Jehovah your God. Walk in his ways and respect him.
"Jehovah your God will lead you into a good land. It is a land with rivers that do not dry up. Springs and underground streams flow through the valleys and the hills.
"The land has wheat and barley, grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates. The land has honey and olive trees for olive oil.
"The land will have enough food for you, and you will have everything you need. The land has rocks with iron ore. You will be able to mine copper ore in the mountains.
"When you have eaten all you want, thank Jehovah your God for the good land he has given you.
"Be careful that you do not forget Jehovah your God. Always obey his judgments and Laws that I give you today.
"You will eat all you want. You will build nice houses and live in them.
"Your herds and flocks, silver and gold, and all that you have will increase.
"When this happens, be careful that you do not become arrogant and forget Jehovah your God. He brought you out of slavery in Egypt.
"He was the one who led you through that vast and dangerous wilderness. It was a parched, arid land, with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He was the one who made water come out of solid rock for you.
"He fed you in the desert with manna. Your fathers had never seen this. He did this in order to humble you and test you. But he also did this so that things would go well for you in the end.
"When you succeed do not brag: ‘ I am rich. I earned it all myself. ’"
"Remember that Jehovah your God gives you the strength to make a living. That is how he keeps the promise he made to your fathers.
"I warn you: ‘ If you forget Jehovah your God and worship other gods, you will perish. ’"
"Jehovah will destroy you, just as he destroyed the nations you fought. This is because you will not listen to him.
"Hear, O Israel, you are about to cross the Jordan River. You will force out nations that are larger and mightier than you, with big cities that have sky-high walls.
"Their people are tall and strong. They are descendants of Anakim. You know all about them. You also heard it said: Who can oppose the descendants of Anak?
"Understand today that Jehovah your God is the one who is going ahead of you like a consuming raging devouring fire. He will wipe them out. Then he will use you to crush their power. You will take possession of their land and will quickly destroy them as Jehovah promised you.
"When Jehovah your God expels these people right before your very eyes, do not say to yourselves: ‘ Jehovah brought us here to possess this land because we live right are righteous. ’ ’ This is not the case. It is because these nations are so wicked that Jehovah is forcing them out of your way.
"It is not because you have been living right or because you are so honest that you enter to take possession of their land. It is because these people are so wicked that Jehovah your God is forcing them out of your way. It is also because Jehovah wants to confirm the promise he swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
"Understand this! It is not because you have been living right that Jehovah your God is giving you this good land to possess. You are a rebellious and impossible stiff-necked stubborn people!
"Never forget how you made Jehovah your God angry in the desert. You rebelled against Jehovah from the day you left Egypt until you came here.
"Even at Mount Horeb you made Jehovah so angry that he wanted to destroy you.
"When I went up on the mountain to get the stone tablets, the tablets of the promise that Jehovah made to you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights without food or water.
"Then Jehovah gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by God’s finger Holy Spirit. On them were written all the words Jehovah spoke to you from the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly.
"At the end of forty days and nights Jehovah gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
"Jehovah said to me: ‘ Go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them. They have made a cast-idol for themselves. ’
"‘ Jehovah spoke further to me: ‘ I have seen this people. They are a very stubborn people.
"‘ Leave me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they. ’
"So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire. I carried the two stone tablets of the covenant in my two hands.
"I saw that you had indeed sinned against Jehovah your God. You made yourselves an idol, cast in the shape of a calf. You turned aside quickly from the way Jehovah had commanded you.
"I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands and smashed them before your eyes.
"I fell down before Jehovah. Like the first, forty days and nights I did not eat or drink. This was because of all your sin you committed in doing what was evil in the sight of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger.
"I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure from Jehovah. For he was wrathful against you to the point of destroying you! But Jehovah listened to me that time also.
"Jehovah was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him! So I also prayed for Aaron at the same time.
"I took your sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it. I ground it very small until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that flowed down the mountain.
"Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked Jehovah to anger.
"‘ Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea. He said: ‘ Go up and possess the land I have given you. ’ ’ Then you rebelled against the command of Jehovah your God. You did not believe him. You did not listen to his voice!
"You have rebelled against Jehovah from the day I knew you.
"So I fell down prostrate before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights. I did this because Jehovah said he would destroy you.
"I prayed to Jehovah and said: ‘ O Jehovah our God, do not destroy your people for they are your inheritance. You have redeemed them through your greatness. You brought them out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
"‘ "Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin.
"‘ "The land from which you brought us may say: "Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land he promised them and because he hated them he has brought them out to slay them in the desert wilderness."
"Even now they are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great power and outstretched arm."
"Jehovah said to me: ‘ Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones. Come up to me on the mountain, and build an ark of wood for yourself.
"‘ I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you shattered. You must place them in the Ark. ’
"I made an Ark out of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the first ones. Then I took the two tablets in my hands and went up on the mountain.
"He wrote on the tablets, like the former writing. It was the Ten Commandments Ten Words that Jehovah proclaimed to you on the mountain. It was from the middle of the fire on the day of the assembly. Jehovah gave them to me.
"Then I came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the Ark I had made. They are there just as Jehovah commanded me.
The sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died. He was buried there. Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place.
From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
Jehovah then set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the covenant of Jehovah. They were to stand before Jehovah to serve and pronounce blessings in his name until this day.
Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers. Jehovah is his inheritance; just as Jehovah your God spoke to him.
"I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time. Jehovah listened to me this time also. Jehovah was not willing to destroy you.
"‘ Jehovah said to me: ‘ Arise and proceed on your journey ahead of the people. That way they may go in and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them. ’
"Now, O Israel, what does Jehovah your God require from you? You are to respect Jehovah your God. Walk in all his ways and love him! Serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your being.
"Obey Jehovah’s commandments and his statutes I am commanding you today for your good!
"Behold, heaven and the highest heavens belong to Jehovah your God, even the earth and all that is in it.
"Yet Jehovah set his affection on your fathers. He loved them. He chose you their descendants above all peoples, as it is this day.
"Circumcise your heart, and do not stiffen your neck. Circumcise: Cut short the foreskin. Remove hardness of the heart.
"Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords! He is the great, the powerful, and the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe.
"He executes justice for the orphan and the widow. He shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.
"Love those who are aliens. For you were also aliens in the land of Egypt.
"Respect Jehovah your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.
"He is your praise! He is your God! He performed for you those great and awesome things you saw with your own eyes.
"Your fathers traveled to Egypt, seventy persons in all. Now Jehovah your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the universe physical heavens.
"Love Jehovah your God, and obey all his laws, regulations and commandments.
"Know today that I do not speak with your sons who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of Jehovah your God. They have not seen his greatness and his awesome power.
"They have not seen his signs and the work he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land.
"And what He did to Egypt's army, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea engulf them while they pursued. Jehovah completely destroyed them!
"They do not know what Jehovah did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place.
"And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them in all Israel.
"You have seen with your own eyes all the great deeds Jehovah did.
"Obey every commandment I command you today. Then you may be strong and go in and possess the land you will cross over to possess.
"Then you may prolong your days on the land Jehovah swore to give to your fathers and their descendants. It is a land flowing with milk and honey.
"The land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you came. You used to sow your seed and irrigate it with your foot as in a vegetable garden.
"But the land you go to possess is a land of hills and valleys. It drinks water from the rain from the clouds in the sky.
"Jehovah your God cares about this land. Jehovah watches over it day after day and year by year.
"If you faithfully obey my commandments that I give you today, love Jehovah your God, and serve him with all your heart and with all your being,
I will send rain on your land at the proper time, both in the fall and in the spring. You will gather your own grain, new wine, and olive oil.
"I will provide grass in the fields for your animals. You will be able to eat and be filled.
"Guard yourselves! Your heart could be deceived. You could turn away and serve other gods and worship them.
"Jehovah will become angry with you. He will shut the sky and there will be no rain. Then the ground will not grow any crops. You will quickly disappear from this good land Jehovah is giving you.
"Take these words of mine to heart and keep them in mind. Write them down, tie them around your wrist, and wear them as headbands to remind you.
"Teach them to your children! Talk about them in your home and away. Speak of them when you lie down or get up.
"Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
"You and your descendants will live a long time in the land that Jehovah promised your ancestors. Your families will live there as long as the sky is above the earth.
"Love Jehovah your God and obey all the laws and teachings I commanded you today. Hold fast to him.
"Then Jehovah will drive out all these nations from before you. You will drive out nations greater and mightier than you.
"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea.
"No man will be able to stand before you. Jehovah your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land where you set foot. This is as he promised you.
"See I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
"Receive the blessing when you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you today.
"Receive the curse when you do not listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside from the way that I command you today, by following other gods you have not known.
"When Jehovah your God brings you into the land you are about to possess, you will offer blessings on Mount Gerizim and cursing on Mount Ebal.
"Are they not across the Jordan toward the setting sun? Are they in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks big trees of Moreh?
"You are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land Jehovah your God is giving you. You must possess it and live in it,
"Be careful to do all the statutes and judgments I present to you today.
"These are the statutes and the judgments you should carefully observe in the land Jehovah, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth.
"Destroy all the places where the nations you dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
"Tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars. Burn their Asherah poles with fire. Cut down the carved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place.
"Do not worship Jehovah your God with such things.
"You should seek Jehovah at the place Jehovah your God chooses out of all your tribes. This is where he will dwell and establish his name. This is where you should go.
"There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, and the contribution of your hand, your vowed offerings, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
"You and your households should eat there before Jehovah your God, and rejoice in all your undertakings that Jehovah your God has blessed.
"Do not behave the way we do here today, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes.
"For you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that Jehovah your God is giving you.
"When you cross the Jordan and live in the land Jehovah your God gives you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security.
"It will happen in the place Jehovah choose for his name to dwell, there you shall bring all that I command you. Bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution of your hand, and all your choice vowed offerings that you will vow to Jehovah.
"Rejoice be filled with joy before Jehovah your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.
"Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place you see,
but in the place Jehovah chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
"In whatever city you live, you may slaughter and eat as much meat as you want from what Jehovah your God has blessed you with. Clean and unclean people may eat it as if they were eating a gazelle or a deer.
"Never eat the blood. Pour it on the ground like water.
"You may not eat Jehovah’s offerings in your cities. Those offerings are: one-tenth of your grain, new wine, and olive oil; the firstborn of your cattle, sheep, or goats; the offerings you vow to bring; your freewill offerings; and your contributions.
"You and your sons and daughters, male and female slaves, and the Levites who live in your cities must eat these in the presence of Jehovah your God at the place he will choose. There in the presence of Jehovah your God enjoy everything for which you have worked.
"Remember to take care of the Levites as long as you live in your land.
"Jehovah your God will expand your country's borders as he promised. You will say: I am hungry for meat. Then eat as much meat as you want.
"If the place Jehovah your God chooses to put his name is too far away from you, you may slaughter an animal from the herds or flocks that Jehovah has given you. Eat as much as you want in your city. I have commanded you to do this.
"Eat it as you would eat a gazelle or a deer. Clean and unclean people may eat it together.
"Make sure you never eat blood, because blood contains life. Never eat the life with the meat.
"Never eat blood! Pour it on the ground like water.
"If you do not eat blood, things will go well for you and your descendants. You will be doing what Jehovah considers right.
"Take the holy things and the offerings you have vowed to bring, and go to the place Jehovah will choose.
"Sacrifice the meat and the blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah your God. The blood of your sacrifices is to be poured out beside the altar of Jehovah your God, but you may eat the meat.
"If you obey these laws, you will be doing what Jehovah your God says is right and good. Then he will help you and your descendants succeed.
"Israel, Jehovah will get rid of the nations you attack. You may have their land.
"Be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them, for they will be destroyed. Do not inquire after their gods, saying: How do these nations serve their gods that I also may do likewise?
"Do not behave this way toward Jehovah your God, for every abominable act Jehovah hates they have done for their gods. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
"Be careful to do what I command you. Do not add to it nor take away from it.
"If a prophet or an interpreter of dreams appears among you and gives you a sign or a wonder portent omen forecast of the future,
in order to lead you to worship and serve gods that you have not worshiped before, and even if what they promise comes true,
do not listen to them. Jehovah your God is allowing them to test you. He will then know that you love Jehovah with all your heart.
"Follow Jehovah and respect him. Obey him and keep his commandments. Worship him and be faithful to him stick to him stay close to him cleave, cling to him.
"Put to death any interpreters of dreams or prophets that tell you to rebel against Jehovah. For he Jehovah rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. Such people are evil and are trying to lead you away from the life that Jehovah has commanded you to live. They must be put to death, in order to get rid of this evil.
"If your brother, your mother's son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your very best friend tries to secretly entice you, saying: ‘ Let us go and serve other gods, gods neither you nor your fathers have known,
"‘ the gods of the people who are around you from one end of the earth to the other end. ’
"Do not yield to him or listen to him. Your eye should not have pity on him. You should not spare or conceal him.
"You must kill him! Your hand should be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
"Stone him to death because he has sought to draw you away from Jehovah your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
"All Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you.
"If you hear in one of the cities Jehovah has given you, anyone saying that
some worthless men have gone out from among you and have mislead the inhabitants of their city, saying: Let us go and serve other gods you have not known.
"Investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the matter established that this abomination has been done among you,
strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword.
"Gather all its treasure into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its treasure with fire as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah your God. It shall be a ruin forever. It shall never be rebuilt.
"Do not take anything that is put under ban. If you comply obey, Jehovah may turn from his burning anger and show mercy to you. He may have compassion on you and make you increase, just as he swore to your fathers.
"You are the sons of Jehovah your God. Do not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead.
"You are a holy people to Jehovah your God. Out of all the people on the face of the earth Jehovah has chosen you to be a people for His own possession.
"Do not eat any detestable thing.
"These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope chamois and the mountain sheep.
"You may eat any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud.
"Do not eat of these that chew the cud, or among those that divide the hoof in two: the camel and the rabbit and the shaphan. Even though they chew the cud, they do not divide the hoof. They are unclean for you.
"The pig, because it divides the hoof but does not chew the cud, it is unclean for you. Do not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses.
"These you may eat of all that are in water: anything that has fins and scales you may eat.
"Do not eat anything that does not have fins and scales. It is unclean for you.
"You may eat any clean bird.
"These are the ones you should not eat: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard,
"And all the teeming life with wings is unclean to you. Do not eat them.
"You may eat any clean bird.
"Do not eat anything that dies by itself. You may give it to the alien who is in your town, so that he may eat it. You may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to Jehovah your God. Do not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
"You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year.
"You shall eat in the presence of Jehovah your God, at the place where He chooses to establish his name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to respect Jehovah your God always.
"The place Jehovah your God will choose to put his name may be too far away. He may bless you with so much that you cannot carry the tithe of your income that far.
"If so, exchange the tenth part of your income for silver. Take the silver with you, and go to the place Jehovah your God will choose.
Use the silver to buy whatever you want: cattle, sheep, goats, wine, liquor-whatever you choose. Then you and your family will eat and enjoy yourselves there in the presence of Jehovah your God.
"Do not neglect the Levites who live in your towns. They have no property of their own.
"At the end of every third year bring the tithe of all your crops and store it in your towns.
"This food is for the Levites, since they own no property, and for the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. They are to come and get all they need. Do this, and Jehovah your God will bless you in everything you do.
"Release all debts at the end of every seven years.
"This is how you should release. Every man who has a loan to his neighbor shall release it. He shall not require it from his neighbor, or from his brother, because it is called Jehovah's release.
"You may collect from a foreigner, but your hand should release that debt which is yours with your brother.
"There should not be any poor people among you. Jehovah your God will certainly bless you in the land he is giving you as your own possession.
"He will bless you only if you listen carefully to Jehovah your God and faithfully obey all these commandments I give you today.
"Jehovah your God will bless you, as he promised. You will make loans to many nations. But you will not have to borrow from any of them. You will rule many nations. But no nation will ever rule over you.
"This is what you must do whenever there are poor Israelites in one of your cities in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.
"Be generous to these poor people. Freely lend them as much as they need. Never be hardhearted and stingy with them.
"When the seventh year, the year when payments on debts are canceled, is near, you might be stingy toward poor Israelites and give them nothing. Be careful not to think these worthless thoughts. The poor will complain to Jehovah about you, and you will be condemned for your sin.
"Give the poor what they need, because then Jehovah will make you successful in everything you do.
"There will always be some Israelites who are poor and needy. That is why I am commanding you to be generous with them.
"If you buy Israelites your own brothers as slaves, you must set them free after six years.
"Do not send him away empty handed when you set him free.
"Supply him liberally from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat. Give to him as Jehovah your God has blessed you.
"Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you. Therefore I command you this today!
"If he says to you: I will not leave you. If it is because he loves you and your household, since he fares well with you,
then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door. He will be your servant for a very long time. You should do likewise to your maidservant.
"It should not seem hard to you when you set him free. After all he has given you six years with double the service of a hired man. Jehovah your God will bless you in whatever you do.
"To Jehovah your God you shall consecrate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock; you shall not work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
"You and your household shall eat it every year before Jehovah your God in the place Jehovah chooses.
"If it has any defect, such as lameness or blindness, or any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to Jehovah your God.
"Eat it within your gates. The unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as a gazelle or a deer.
"Do not eat its blood! Pour it out on the ground like water.
"Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God. It was in the month of Abib that Jehovah your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
"Sacrifice the Passover to Jehovah your God from the flock and the herd, in the place where Jehovah chooses to establish his name.
"Do not eat leavened bread with it. Eat unleavened bread for seven days. It is the bread of affliction. You should remember all the days of your life the day when you came out of the land of Egypt in haste.
"No leaven should be seen with you in all your territory for seven days. None of the flesh you sacrifice on the evening of the first day shall remain overnight until morning.
"You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover in any of your towns Jehovah your God is giving you.
"Cook and eat it in the place Jehovah your God chooses. In the morning you are to return to your tents.
"Eat unleavened bread for six days. On the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly to Jehovah your God. Do not do work on it.
"You shall count seven weeks for yourself. Count off seven weeks from the beginning of your grain harvest.
"Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to Jehovah your God. Bring a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings Jehovah your God has given you.
"Enjoy yourselves in the presence of Jehovah your God along with your sons, daughters, male and female slaves, the Levites who live in your cities, the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live among you. Enjoy yourselves at the place Jehovah your God will choose as a dwelling for his name.
"Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. Carefully obey these laws.
"Gather the grain from your threshing floor and make your wine. Then celebrate the Festival of Booths for seven days.
"Enjoy yourselves at the festival along with your sons, daughters, male and female slaves, the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your cities.
"For seven days you will celebrate this festival dedicated to Jehovah your God in the place he will choose. You will enjoy yourselves, because Jehovah your God will bless all your harvest and all your work.
"Three times a year all your men must come into the presence of Jehovah your God at the place he will choose. At the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. But no one may come into the presence of Jehovah without an offering.
"Every man shall give, as he is able; according to the blessing Jehovah your God has given you.
"Appoint judges and officers for your tribes in every city Jehovah your God gives you. They are to judge the people fairly.
"Never pervert justice. Always be impartial. Never take a bribe, because bribes blind wise people and deny justice to those who are in the right.
"Only strive for justice so you will live and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.
"When you build the altar for Jehovah your God, never plant beside it any tree dedicated to the goddess Asherah.
"Never set up a sacred stone. These are things Jehovah your God hates.
"Never offer a bull or a sheep that has a defect or anything seriously wrong with it as a sacrifice to Jehovah your God. That is an abomination to him.
"In one of the cities Jehovah your God is giving you, there may be a man or woman among you who is doing what Jehovah considers evil. This person may be disregarding the conditions of Jehovah’s covenant.
"Some worship and bow down to other gods, the sun, the moon, or the whole army of heaven. I have forbidden this.
"If it is told you and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire thoroughly. If it is true and the thing certain that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,
"Bring that man or woman who has done this evil deed out to your gates. Stone the man or the woman to death.
"On the evidence and testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. He shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness.
"The witnesses must throw the first stone to put him to death, and afterward all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
"If any case is too difficult for you to decide, between one kind of homicide or another, between one kind of lawsuit or another, and between one kind of assault or another, being cases of dispute in your courts, then you should go to the place Jehovah your God chooses.
"Approach the Levitical priest or the judge who is in office in those days. Inquire of them and they will declare to you the verdict in the case.
"Act according to the terms of the verdict they declare to you from that place Jehovah chooses. Be careful to abide by all that they teach you.
"Act according to the verdict and the terms they tell you. Do not turn away from the word they declare to you.
"The man who acts presumptuously and does not listen to the priest or the judge will die. This way you will purge the evil from Israel. The priests and judges are there to serve Jehovah your God.
"Then all the people will hear and be afraid. They will not act presumptuously again.
"Enter the land Jehovah your God gives you. Possess it and live in it. You will say: I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me,
you shall surely set a king over you whom Jehovah your God chooses. It will be one from among your countrymen. You may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman.
"He must not increase his herd of horses. He must not send the people to return to Egypt to get more horses. For Jehovah said to you: You should never again return that way.
"He must not take many wives or his heart will turn astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
"When he first sits on the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll taken in the presence of the Levitical priests.
"He should keep it with him. He should read from it all the days of his life. In this way he will learn to respect Jehovah his God by carefully observing all the words of this Law and these statutes.
"He must not think he is better than the rest of his people. He will not disobey these commandments in any way. So he and his sons will rule for a long time in Israel.
"The Levitical priests including the entire tribe of Levi will receive no land or property of their own like the rest of the Israelites. They will eat what has been sacrificed to Jehovah. These sacrifices will be what they receive.
"They are to own no land, as the other tribes do. Their inheritance is the privilege of being Jehovah’s priests, as Jehovah told them.
"When cattle or sheep are sacrificed, the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jaw, and the stomach.
"They are to receive the first share of the grain, wine, olive oil, and wool.
"Jehovah chose from all your tribes the tribe of Levi to serve him and his sons as priests forever.
"Any Levite who wants to may come from any town in Israel to the one place of worship.
"He may serve there, as a priest of Jehovah his God, like the other Levites who are serving there.
"He is to receive the same amount of food as the other priests. He may keep everything his family sends him.
"When you come into the land that Jehovah your God gives you, do not follow the disgusting practices of the nations that are there.
"Do not sacrifice your children in the fires on your altars. Do not let your people practice divination or look for omens or use spells or charms.
"Do not allow them to consult the spirits of the dead.
"Jehovah your God hates people who do these disgusting things. That is why he is driving those nations out of the land as you advance.
"Be perfect without blemish with Jehovah your God.
"These nations whom you shall possess listened to observers of clouds and to diviners. As for you, Jehovah your God has not allowed you to do so.
"Jehovah your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your fellow Israelites. Listen to him!
"This is according to all that you asked of Jehovah your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly. You said: Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God. Do not let me see this great fire anymore, or I will die.
"Jehovah said to me: ‘ They have spoken well.
"‘ I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you. I will put my words in his mouth. He will speak to them all that I command him.
"‘ Whoever refuses to listen to the words that the prophet speaks in my name will answer to me.
"‘ Any prophet who dares to say something in my name that I did not command him to say or who speaks in the name of other gods must die.
"‘" You may wonder: "How shall we recognize that Jehovah did not speak this message?"
"If a prophet speaks in Jehovah’s name and what he says does not happen or come true, then it did not come from Jehovah. That prophet has spoken on his own authority. Never be afraid of him. ’
"When Jehovah your God destroys all the nations that are living in the land that he gives you. you will force them out and live in their cities and houses.
"When all this is done, set aside three cities in the land that Jehovah your God gives you.
"A person who unintentionally kills someone he never hated in the past may run to one of these cities to save his life.
"For example: when a man goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron head slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies. He may flee to one of these cities and live.
"Otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in the heat of his anger. He may overtake him and because the way is long he may take his life. Even though he was not deserving of death, since he had not hated him previously.
"Hear my command: ‘ You must set aside three cities for yourself. ’
"If Jehovah your God enlarges your territory, just as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land he promised to give your fathers.
"And if you carefully observe all this commandment I command you today, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in his ways always you shall add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.
"Innocent blood will not be shed in your land that Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance. Blood guiltiness will not be on you.
"But if there is a man who hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and murders him. If he flees to one of these cities,
"the elders of his city will send for him. They will take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die.
"Do not pity him. Purge the blood of the innocent from Israel that it may go well with you.
"Do not move your neighbor's boundary mark. The ancestors have set this in your inheritance. You will inherit this in the land Jehovah your God gives you to possess.
"One witness is not enough to convict someone of a crime, offense, or sin he may have committed. Cases must be settled based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
"This is what you must do whenever a witness takes the stand to accuse a person falsely of a crime.
"The two people involved must stand in Jehovah’s presence, in front of the priests and judges who are serving at that time.
"The judges must make a thorough investigation. If it is found that the witness lied when he testified against the other Israelite,
do to him what he planned to do to the other person. Get rid of this evil.
"When other people hear about this, they will be afraid. Never again will such an evil thing be done among you.
"Have no pity on him: Take a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.
"When you go to war against your enemies, you may see horses, chariots, and armies larger than yours. Do not be afraid of them for Jehovah your God, who brought you out of Egypt, will be with you.
"A priest must come and speak to the troops before the battle begins.
He should say: "Listen, Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not lose your courage! Do not be afraid. Do not tremble because of them.
"Jehovah your God is going with you. He will fight for you against your enemies and give you victory.
"The officers should speak to the army: If you have built a new house that has not been dedicated, you may go home. Otherwise, you might die in battle, and someone else will dedicate it.
"Have you planted a vineyard and not used its fruits? Go home to your house and vineyard. If you die in battle another man will use its fruit.
"Is there anyone here engaged to be married? If so, he should go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will marry the woman he is engaged to.
"The officers will also say to the men: Is there any man here who has lost his nerve and is afraid? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, he will destroy the morale of the others.
"When the officers finish speaking to the army, leaders are to be chosen for each unit.
"When you go to attack a city, first give its people a chance to surrender.
"If they open the gates and surrender, they will all become your slaves and do forced labor for you.
"If the people of that city choose to fight and will not surrender, surround it with your army.
"When Jehovah your God lets you capture the city, kill every man in it.
"You may take the women, the children, the livestock, and everything else in the city for yourselves. You may use everything that belongs to your enemies. Jehovah has given it to you.
"This is what you must do to all the cities that are far away that do not belong to the nations nearby.
"Do not spare anyone's life in the cities of these nations Jehovah your God is giving you as your property.
"You must capture the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites for Jehovah and completely destroy them. Jehovah your God commands you.
"Otherwise, they will teach you to do all the disgusting things they do for their gods. You will sin against Jehovah your God.
"This is what you must do whenever you blockade a city for a long time in order to capture it in war. Do not harm any of its fruit trees with an ax. You may eat the fruit. Never cut those trees down, because the trees of the field are not people you have come to blockade.
"You may destroy trees that you know are not fruit trees. You may cut them down and use them in your blockade until you capture the city.
"This is what you must do if you find a murder victim lying in a field in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you. If no one knows who committed the murder,
your elders and judges must go and measure the distance from the body to each of the neighboring cities.
"When it is determined which city is nearest the body, the elders from that city must choose a heifer that has never been put to work and never worn a yoke.
"The elders of that city will bring the heifer down to a river, to a location where the land has not been plowed or planted. At the river they must break the heifer's neck.
"Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near. Jehovah your God has chosen them to serve him and to bless in the name of Jehovah. They will settle every dispute and every assault.
"All the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
"They will answer: ‘ Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did we see it.
"‘ Forgive your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, O Jehovah. Do not hold us responsible for the murder of an innocent person. ’ ’ Forgive them of bloodguilt.
"Remove the guilt of innocent blood from your midst. Do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah’s.
"When you go to war with your enemies and Jehovah your God hands them over to you, you may take them captive.
"If you see a beautiful woman among the captives and your heart is set on her, you may marry her.
"Take her to your home. She should shave her head and cut her nails.
"She should no longer wear the clothes she was wearing when you captured her. She may live in your house and mourn the loss of her father and mother for one month. After that you may marry her.
"Later if you are not happy with the woman you may divorce her. She may go free. But you have slept with her as your wife, so you cannot sell her as a slave or make her into your own slave.
"If a man have two wives and loves one more than the other. The first son of either wife is the man's first-born son, even if the boy's mother is the wife he does not love. A man near death and dividing up his property must give a double share to his first-born son. This is because he was the first to be born.
"The day he wills his possessions to his sons, he should not put the firstborn son of the loved wife before the firstborn son of the unloved wife.
"He should acknowledge the firstborn son of the unloved wife. And give him a double portion of all that he has. He is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
"If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not listen or obey his father or his mother when they chastise him,
"His father and mother shall seize him, and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gateway of his hometown.
"They shall say to the elders of his city: This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious! He will not obey us! He is a glutton and a drunkard.
"All the men of his city shall stone him to death. In that way you will remove the evil from your midst. All Israel will hear about it and fear.
"If a man commits a sin worthy of death and he is put to death. You hang him on a tree stake.
"His corpse must not hang all night on the tree stake. Be sure to bury him the same day for he who is hanged is accursed of God. You do this so that you do not defile your land Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance.
"If your brother’s bull or sheep stray do not ignore them. Bring them back to your brother.
"If you are not acquainted with your brother, or you just do not know him, then you should bring it home to your house. Keep it with you until your brother looks for it. Then you should give it to him.
"You should do the same with his donkey and his garment. You should do likewise with anything lost by your brother found by you. Do not ignore it.
"You should not see your brothers donkey or his bull fallen down on the way, and pay no attention to them. Help him lift it to its feet.
"A woman must not wear man's clothing or a man women’s clothing. The person who does these things is an abomination to Jehovah your God.
"If you find a bird's nest near the road, in a tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs in it. The mother could be sitting on the young or on eggs. Do not take the mother with the young.
"Let the mother go. You may take the young. Let the mother go. May things go well with you and you may prolong your days.
"When you build a new house make a parapet wall for your roof. This way you will not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone falls from it.
"Do not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, or all the produce of the seed that you have sown and the increase of the vineyard will become defiled.
"Do not plow with a bull and a donkey together.
"Do not wear a material mixed with wool and linen together.
"You should attach tassels to the four corners of your cloaks.
"If a man marries a woman and has sex with her and then turns against her,
he charges her with shameful deeds and publicly defames her. He says: ‘ When I had sex with this woman, I did not find proof of her virginity. ’
"The girl's father and her mother must present evidence of the girl's virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.
"The girl's father shall say to the elders: I gave my daughter to be this man’s wife, but he turned against her.
"He has charged her with shameful deeds. He says: ‘ I did not find your daughter to be a virgin." "But this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity." And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
"The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him,
"They will fine him a hundred shekels of silver. They will give it to the girl's father, because he publicly defamed a virgin of Israel. She will remain his wife. He may not divorce her all his days.
"On the other hand if this charge is true, that the girl was not found a virgin,
they will take the girl to the doorway of her father's house. The men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed an act of folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's house. You must purge the evil from among you.
"If a man is caught having sexual intercourse with another mans wife, then both of them shall die! Both the man and the woman committing adultery must be killed. Thus you shall purge the evil from Israel.
"Suppose there is a girl who is a virgin engaged to a man, and another man has sexual relations with her.
"You must bring them both out to the gate of that city and you must stone them to death! The girl did not protest what was happening and the man has violated his neighbor's woman. Thus you shall purge the evil from among you.
"If an engaged woman is raped forced to experience sex only the man who commits the act will die.
"Do nothing to the woman. There is no sin in the woman worthy of death. This is like the case where a man attacks and murders his neighbor.
"When he found her in the field, the woman who is engaged protested, but there was no one to save her.
"Suppose a man finds a woman who is a virgin, who is not engaged, and seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered.
The man who has sex with her must give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver, and she will become his wife because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days.
"A man must not have sexual intercourse with his father's wife. This would violate his father.
"No man whose testicles have been crushed or whose penis is cut off shall enter the assembly of Jehovah.
"No one of illegitimate birth shall enter the assembly of Jehovah. None of his descendants to the tenth generation shall enter the assembly of Jehovah.
"No Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly of Jehovah. Their descendants to the tenth generation shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah.
"This is because they did not meet you with food and water on the way when you came out of Egypt. It is because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
"Jehovah your God was not willing to listen to Balaam. Jehovah your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because Jehovah your God loves you.
"Never seek peace or try to help the Ammonites or the Moabites as long as you live.
"Do not detest an Edomite for he is your brother. Do not detest an Egyptian, because you were an alien strangers guests in his land.
"The sons of the third generation who are born to them may enter the assembly of Jehovah.
"Guard yourself from every evil thing when your army goes to war against your enemies.
"If there is among you any man who is unclean because of a nocturnal emission he must go outside the camp. He may not reenter the camp.
"When evening approaches he should bathe himself with water. He may reenter the camp at sundown.
"Set up a toilet area outside the camp and go out there.
"Keep a spade among your tools. When you sit down outside use the spade to dig and cover up your excrement.
"Jehovah your God walks in the middle of your camp. He is there to deliver you and to defeat your enemies before you. Therefore your camp must be holy. He must not see anything indecent among you or He will turn away from you.
"Do not hand over an escaped slave to his master.
"Let him live with you in your midst. Let him choose a place in one of your towns where it pleases him. Do not mistreat him.
"None of the daughters of the sons of Israel shall be a temple prostitute.
"Do not bring the hire fee of a harlot or the wages of a dog into the house of Jehovah your God for any vow offering. Both of these are an abomination to Jehovah your God.
"Do not charge interest to your brothers, interest on money, food, anything that may be loaned at interest.
"You may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your brother countrymen you shall not charge interest. That way Jehovah your God will bless you in all that you undertake in the land you are about to possess.
"When you vow to Jehovah your God do not delay the payback. It would be sin, and Jehovah your God will surely require it of you.
"It would not be sin if you refrain from vowing.
"Be careful to perform the promise that comes from your lips, just as you have voluntarily vowed to Jehovah your God. Keep your promise.
"When you enter your neighbor's vineyard you may eat grapes until you are full. But you shall not put any in your basket.
"When you enter your neighbor's standing grain you may pluck the heads with your hand. But you must not wield a sickle in your neighbor's standing grain.
"When a man marries a woman and later decides he does not love her because he found something he does not like about her he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out from his house.
"She leaves his house and becomes another man's wife.
"If the latter husband turns against her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife,
"her former husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife. She has been defiled. That is an abomination before Jehovah, and you shall not bring sin on the land Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance.
"A newly married man must not be drafted into the army or charged with any duty. He shall be free at home one year and shall give happiness to the wife he has married.
"Do not take a hand mill or an upper millstone as security for a debt. That would be taking away a man’s livelihood.
"If a man is caught kidnapping any of his brothers of the sons of Israel, and he deals with him violently or sells him, the thief shall die. You will purge the evil from among you.
"Stay away from the infection of leprosy. Diligently observe and do according to all that the Levitical priests teach you. I have commanded them, so be careful to obey.
"Remember what Jehovah your God did to Miriam on the road out of Egypt.
"When you make your neighbor a loan of any sort do not go into his house and repossess the security.
"Remain outside, and the man to whom you make the loan must bring the pledged security out to you.
"If he is a poor man, do not keep the pledged security over night.
"Return the pledge to him before the sun goes down. He will have his pledged item and he may sleep. He will bless you. And it will be righteousness for you before Jehovah your God.
"Do not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers or one of your aliens who is in your land in your towns.
"Pay him his wages on the workday day before the sunsets. He is poor and sets his heart on it. He will not complain against you to Jehovah and it becomes your sin.
"Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers. Everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.
"Do not pervert the justice due an alien or an orphan. Do not take a widow's garment in pledge.
"Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and that Jehovah your God redeemed you from there. I therefore command you to do this.
"When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it. It shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow, in order that Jehovah your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
"When you beat the olives from your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again. It shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow.
"When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not go over it again. It shall be for the alien, for the orphan, and for the widow.
"You must remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. I am commanding you to do this.
"When there is a dispute between men and they go to court, and the judges decide their case. They justify the righteous and condemn the wicked.
"If the wicked man deserves to be beaten, the judge will then make him lie down and be beaten in his presence. The number of lashes is according to his guilt.
"He must not beat him more than forty lashes. If he beats more than that your brother will be degraded in your eyes.
"Do not muzzle the bull while he is threshing.
"When brothers live together and one of them dies without a son the wife of the deceased shall not marry outside the family to a strange man. Her husband's brother shall marry her and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
"The firstborn son she bears will assume the name of the dead brother. That way his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
"If the man does not desire to take his brother's wife, his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say: My husband's brother refuses to establish a name for his brother in Israel. He is not willing to perform the duty of a husband's brother to me.
"The elders of his city must summon him and speak to him. If he persists and says: I do not desire to take her,
his brother's wife shall must to him in the sight of the elders. She will pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face. Then she will declare: It is done to the man who does not build up his brother's house.
"His name in Israel will be: ‘ The house of him whose sandal is removed. ’
"If two brothers struggle together and the wife of one approaches to help her husband against the other man, and puts out her hand and seizes his genitals,
you must cut off her hand. Do not show pity.
"Do not have differing weights, a large and a small, in your bag.
"You must have a full and just weight. You should have a full and just measure, that your days may be prolonged in the land Jehovah your God gives you.
"Everyone who does these things, everyone who acts unjustly is an abomination to Jehovah your God.
"Remember what Amalek did to you along the way when you came out from Egypt.
"He met you along the way and attacked among you all the stragglers at your rear when you were faint and weary. He did not respect God.
"When Jehovah your God has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies, in the land Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance to possess. You will blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget.
"When you enter the land Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance you will possess it and live in it.
"Take some of the first of all the produce of the ground that you bring in from your land that Jehovah your God gives you, and put it in a basket and go to the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name.
"Go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him: I declare this day to Jehovah my God! I have entered the land Jehovah swore to our fathers to give us.
"The priest will take the basket from your hand and set it down before the altar of Jehovah your God.
"Answer before Jehovah your God: ‘ My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt and traveled there. They were few in number but he became a great, mighty and populous nation.
"‘ The Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us. They imposed hard labor on us.
"‘ We cried out to Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice. He saw our affliction and our toil and our oppression.
"‘ Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror and with signs and wonders.
"‘ He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
"‘ Now behold, I have brought the first of the produce of the ground that You, O Jehovah have given me. Set it down before Jehovah your God, and worship before Jehovah your God. ’
"You, the Levite and the alien among you will rejoice in all the good Jehovah your God has given you and your household.
‘ Finish paying all the tithe of your increase in the third year, the year of tithing. Then you shall give it to the Levite, the stranger, and the orphan and to the widow, that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.
"Say before Jehovah your God: ‘ I have removed the sacred portion from my house. I also have given it to the Levite and the alien, the orphan and the widow, according to all your commandments that you have commanded me. I have not transgressed or forgotten any of your commandments.
"‘ I have not eaten of it while mourning. I have not removed any of it while I was unclean, nor offered any of it to the dead. I have listened to the voice of Jehovah my God. I have done according to all that you have commanded me.
"‘ Look down from your holy place in heaven and bless your people Israel. Bless the ground you have given us, a land flowing with milk and honey, as you swore to our fathers. ’
"This day Jehovah your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances. You shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your being.
"You declared Jehovah to be your God today. You said you would walk in his ways and keep his statutes, his commandments and his ordinances, and listen to his voice.
"Jehovah declared you to be his people and a treasured possession. Obey his commandments and receive his promise.
"He will set you high above all nations that he has made, for praise, fame, and honor. You will be a consecrated people to Jehovah your God, as he has spoken.
Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people. They said: "Keep all the commandments that I command you today.
"This is the way it will be on the day when you cross the Jordan to the land that Jehovah your God gives you. You will set up for yourself large stones and coat them with lime
and write on them all the words of the Law. When you cross over to enter the land Jehovah your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, the God of your fathers, promised you.
"When you cross the Jordan, you shall set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you shall coat them with lime.
"Build an altar there to Jehovah your God. Build the altar of stones. Do not use an iron tool on them.
"Build the altar of Jehovah your God of uncut stones. Offer on it burnt offerings to Jehovah your God
and sacrifice peace offerings and eat there, and rejoice before Jehovah your God.
"Write on the stones all the words of the Law very distinctly."
Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel. They said: "Be silent and listen, O Israel! This day you have become a people for Jehovah your God.
"Obey Jehovah your God, and do his commandments and his statutes which I command you today."
Moses also charged the people on that day. He said:
"When you cross the Jordan, these will stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
"For the curse, these will stand on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
"The Levites will answer all the men of Israel with a loud voice:
"‘ Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image. It is an abomination to Jehovah! It is the secret work of the hands of the craftsman. All the people will answer: Amen.
"‘ Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or mother. All the people will say: Amen.
"‘ Cursed is he who moves his neighbor's boundary mark. All the people will say: Amen.
"‘ Cursed is the man who misleads a blind person on the road. And all the people answer: Amen.
"‘ Cursed is he who withholds justice due an alien, orphan, and widow. The people all say: Amen.

"‘ Cursed is he who indulges in sex with his mother-in-law. And all the people say: Amen.
"‘ Cursed is he who beats his neighbor in secret. ’ ’ And all the people will say: ‘ Amen. ’
"‘ Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to punish an innocent person. ’ ’ All the people will say: ‘ Amen. ’
"‘ Cursed is he who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law by obeying them. ’ ’ And all the people will say: ‘ Amen. ’
"Carefully obey Jehovah your God. Faithfully follow all his commandments that I give you today. If you do this Jehovah your God will place you high above all the other nations in the world.
"These are all the blessings that will come to you and stay close to you because you obey Jehovah your God:
"Jehovah will bless your towns and your fields.
"Jehovah will bless you with many children, with abundant crops, and with many cattle and sheep.
"Jehovah will bless your grain crops and the food you prepare from them.
"Jehovah will make you successful in your daily work.
"Jehovah will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you: they shall come out against you one-way, and shall flee before you seven ways.
"Jehovah will command the blessing upon you in your barns and in all that you put your hand to, and He will bless you in the land Jehovah your God gives you.
"Jehovah will establish you as a holy people to himself. He swore this to you, if you obey the commandments of Jehovah your God and walk in His ways.
"All the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of Jehovah, and they will be afraid of you.
"Jehovah will make you abound in prosperity, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your animals and in the produce of your ground, the land that Jehovah swore to your fathers to give you.
"Jehovah will open for you his good storehouse. The skies will give rain to your land in due season. It will bless all the work of your hand. You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow.
"Jehovah will make you the head and not the tail, and you only will be above, and you will not be underneath. If you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I charge you today, to observe them carefully,
and do not turn aside from any of the words I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
"If you do not obey Jehovah your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes with which I charge you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:
"Cursed will you be in the city, and cursed will you be in the country.
"Your basket and your kneading bowl will be cursed.
"Cursed will be the offspring of your body and the produce of your ground, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock.
"Jehovah will curse everything you do!
"If you do evil and reject Jehovah, he will bring on you trouble, confusion, and rebuke in everything you do. Soon you will be quickly and completely destroyed.
"He will plague you with disease after disease on you until there is not one of you left in the land.
"Jehovah will strike you with infectious diseases, with swelling and fever. He will send drought and scorching winds to destroy your crops. These disasters will be with you until you die.
"The sky above will look like copper and the ground below will be as hard as iron.
Jehovah will send dust storms and sandstorms on you from the sky until you are destroyed.
"Jehovah will cause you to be stricken before your enemies. You will go out one way against them, and flee seven ways from them. You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
"Your body will be food to all birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth. And no man shall frighten them away.
"Jehovah will strike you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors and with the scab and with the itch, from which you cannot be healed.
"You will become insane and go blind. Jehovah will make you so confused,
that even in bright sunshine you will have to feel your way around like a blind person. You will tell day from night! For the rest of your life, people will beat and rob you. No one will be able to stop them.
"A man will be engaged to a woman, but before they can get married, enemy soldiers will rape her. Some of you will build houses, but never get to live in them. If you plant a vineyard, you will not be around long enough to enjoy the first harvest.
"Your cattle will be killed while you watch. You will not get to eat any of the meat. Your donkeys and sheep will be stolen. No one will be around to force your enemies to give them back.
"Your sons and daughters will be dragged off to a foreign country. And you will stand there helpless. Even if you watch for them until you go blind, you will never see them again.
"A foreign nation will take all the crops that you have worked so hard to grow. You will receive nothing but constant oppression and harsh treatment.
"You will lose your mind experience insanity because of all the suffering.
"Jehovah will strike you on the knees and legs with sore boils. From the sole of your foot to the crown of your head they will not heal.
"Jehovah will bring you and your king, whom you set over you, to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known. There you will serve other gods made of wood and stone.
"You will become a thing of revulsion. All the nations where Jehovah will send you will make an example of you and laugh at you.
"You will plant many crops in your fields, but harvest little for locusts will destroy your crops.
"You will plant vineyards and tend them but will not drink the wine from them. Worms will eat them.
"You will have olive trees throughout all your coasts, but you shall not anoint with the oil, for your olive shall drop off its fruit.
"Even your infant sons and daughters will be taken as prisoners of war.
"Locusts will take over all your trees and the fruit of your land.
"The alien who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you, while you go down lower and lower.
"They will be able to make loans to you, but you won't be able to make loans to them. They will be the head, and you will be the tail.
"All these disasters will come on you. They will be with you until you are destroyed. This is because you did not obey Jehovah your God and keep all the laws that he gave you.
"Everyone will look at you and your descendants and realize that Jehovah has placed you under a curse for a very long time.
"You did not serve Jehovah your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things.
"You will serve your enemies whom Jehovah will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.
"Jehovah will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle swoops down, a nation whose language you will not understand,
a nation of fierce countenance who will have no respect for the old, nor show favor to the young.
"They will eat the offspring of your animals and the crops from your fields until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, no new wine, no olive oil, no calves from your herds, and no lambs or kids from your flocks. They will continue to do this until you are completely desolate.
"They will blockade all your cities until the high, fortified walls you trust come down everywhere in your land. They will blockade all the cities everywhere in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.
"Because of the hardships your enemies will make you suffer during the blockade, you will eat the flesh of your own children, the sons and daughters, whom Jehovah your God has given you.
"The kindest and most sensitive man among you will become stingy toward his brother, the wife he loves, and the children he still has left.
"The kindest and most sensitive woman among you, so sensitive and tender that she would not even step on an ant, will become stingy toward the husband she loves or toward her own son or daughter.
"You might not faithfully obey every word of the teachings that are written in this book. You might not respect this glorious and awe inspiring name: JEHOVAH your God.
"If so, Jehovah will strike you and your descendants with unimaginable plagues. They will be terrible continuing plagues. They will be severe and lingering diseases.
"He will bring all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded. They will cling to you.
"Jehovah will also bring you every kind of sickness and plague not written in this Book of the Law. They will continue until you are dead.
"You were at one time as numerous as the stars in the sky. But only a few of you will be left. This is because you did not obey Jehovah your God.
"Jehovah was very glad to make you prosperous and numerous. Now Jehovah will be more than glad to destroy you and wipe you out. You will be torn out of the land you are about to enter and possess.
"Jehovah will scatter you among all the people of the world. He will scatter you from one end of the earth to the other. There you will serve gods made of wood and stone that neither you nor your ancestors ever knew.
"You will find no peace among those nations. There will be no place to call your own. There Jehovah will give you an unsettled mind, failing eyesight, and despair.
"Your life will always be in danger. Day and night you will be filled with terror. You will live in constant fear of death.
"Your hearts will pound with fear at everything you see. Every morning you will wish for evening. Every evening you will wish for morning.
"Jehovah will send you back to Egypt in ships, even though he said that you would never have to go there again. There you will try to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves. But no one will want to buy you.
These are the terms of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab. All this was in addition to the covenant Jehovah made with them at Mount Sinai.
Moses called together all the people of Israel and said: "You saw for yourselves what Jehovah did to the king of Egypt, to his officials, and to his entire country.
"You saw the terrible plagues, the miracles, and the great wonders that Jehovah performed.
"To this very day Jehovah has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, or ears to hear.
"I led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you. Your sandal has not worn out on your foot.
"You have not eaten bread. You have not drunk wine or strong drink. This in order that you might know that I am Jehovah your God.
When you reached this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle. We defeated them!
"We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites.
"Keep the words of this covenant to do them that you may prosper in all that you do.
"You stand today, all of you, before Jehovah your God: your leaders, your tribes, your elders and your officers, even all the men of Israel.
"Your little ones, your wives, and the alien who is within your camps, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water,
that you may enter into the covenant with Jehovah your God, and into His oath that Jehovah your God is making with you today.
"Jehovah will confirm today with this promise that you are his people and that he is your God. This is what he told you. This is what he promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with an oath.
"You are not the only people to receive this promise and its conditions.
"It is for those of you who are standing here with us today in the presence of Jehovah our God and also for those who are not here today.
"You know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through other countries on our way here.
"You saw their loathsome idols made of wood, stone, silver, and gold.
"Make sure that no man, woman, family, or tribe standing here today turns from Jehovah our God to serve the gods of other nations. This would be like a root that grows to be a bitter and poisonous plant.
"Be sure there is no one here today who hears these solemn demands and yet convinces himself that all will be well with him. He would go stubbornly on his own way. That would destroy all of you, good and evil alike.
Jehovah will never be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of Jehovah and His jealousy will burn against that man. Every curse which is written in this book will rest on him. Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.
"Jehovah will destroy you by piling on you all the curses that are written in this book of Law. You will be forgotten forever.
"The next generation of your children and foreigners who come from distant countries will see the plagues that have happened in this land and the diseases Jehovah sent here.
"All its land is brimstone and salt. It is a burning waste, unsown and unproductive. No grass grows on it. Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath.
"All the nations will say: Why has Jehovah done thus to this land? Why this great outburst of anger? '
"Then men will say: ‘ Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
"‘ They served other gods and worshiped them. These are gods whom they have not known and whom he had not allotted to them.
"‘ Jehovah became angry against this land and brought on it all the curses described in this book.
"‘ His fierce anger and fury caused Jehovah to uproot these people from their land and deported them to another country. This is where they still are today. ’
"Some secret things are hidden. They belong to Jehovah our God. The things that have been revealed in these teachings belong to us and to our children forever. We must obey every word of this Law.
"All these blessings and curses I have spoken about will happen to you. Take them to heart when you are among all the nations where Jehovah your God will scatter you.
"If you and your children return to Jehovah your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your being, doing everything I command you today,
he will restore your fortunes. He will have mercy on you and gather you from all the nations of the world where he has scattered you.
"Jehovah your God will gather you from the ends of the earth. He will bring you back.
"Jehovah your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed. You will possess it. He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.
"Jehovah your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, to LOVE JEHOVAH YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR BEING, that you may live.
"Jehovah your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you and who persecute you.
"You shall again obey Jehovah, and observe all his commandments that I command you today.
"Jehovah your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand. In the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground, you will prosper. Jehovah will again rejoice over you for good, just as he rejoiced over your fathers;
if you obey Jehovah your God to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to Jehovah your God with all your heart with all your being.
"This commandment that I command you today is not too difficult for you. It is not out of reach.
"It is not in heaven, that you should say: Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may obey it?
"This commandment is not on the other side of the sea. You do not have to ask: Who will cross the sea to get it for us so that we can hear it and obey it?
"No, these words are very near you. They are in your mouth and in your heart so that you will obey them.
"I set before you today life and good, death and evil.
"I command you today to Love Jehovah your God, follow his directions, and obey his commandments, laws, and rules. Then you will live, your population will increase, and Jehovah your God will bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
"If your hearts turn away, and you do not listen, you might be tempted to bow down to other gods and worship them.
"If you do, I tell you today that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live for a long time in the land that you are about to possess when you cross the Jordan River.
"I call on heaven and earth as witnesses today that I have offered you life or death, blessings or curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants will live.
"LOVE JEHOVAH YOUR GOD, OBEY HIM, AND BE LOYAL TO HIM. THIS WILL BE YOUR WAY OF LIFE. It will mean a long life for you in the land that Jehovah swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Moses continued to speak to all the Israelites:
"I am one hundred and twenty years old now. I am not able to lead you anymore. Jehovah has told me that I may not cross the Jordan River.
"Jehovah your God is the one who will cross the river ahead of you. He will destroy those nations as you arrive. You will take possession of their land. Joshua will also cross the river ahead of you, as Jehovah told you.
"Jehovah will destroy those people, just as he defeated Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites, and destroyed their country.
"Jehovah will give you victory over them. You are to treat them exactly as I have told you.
"Be determined and with good courage. Do not be afraid of them. Your God, Jehovah, will be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you.
Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the presence of all the people of Israel: "Be determined and with good courage. You are the one who will lead these people to occupy the land Jehovah promised to their ancestors.
"Jehovah is the one who goes ahead of you. He will be with you. He will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be downhearted."
Moses wrote this Law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.
Moses commanded them: "At the end of every seven years, at the time of the year of remission of debts, at the Feast of Booths,
when all Israel comes to appear before Jehovah your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this Law in front of all Israel in their hearing.
"Assemble the people, the men and the women and children and the alien who is in your town. Assemble them that they may hear and learn and respect Jehovah your God, and be careful to observe all the words of this Law.
"Their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to respect Jehovah your God, as long as you live on the land you will possess when you cross the Jordan River.
Then Jehovah said to Moses: "Behold, the time for you to die is near. Call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
Jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud. The pillar of cloud stood at the doorway of the tent.
Jehovah said to Moses: "You are about to lie down with your fathers in death. This people will arise and play the harlot with the strange gods of the land. They will plunge into the midst of it. They will forsake me and break my covenant that I made with them.
"‘ My anger will be kindled against them in that day. I will abandon them and hide my face from them. They will be consumed by many evils and troubles. They will say in that day: ‘ Is it because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us? ’
"I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil they will do. They will turn to other gods.
"Write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel. Put it on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel.
"When I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn me and break my covenant.
"Then it will happen, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness. It shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants. I know the intent they are developing today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore."
So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.
Jehovah gave this command to Joshua, son of Nun: "Be strong and courageous, because you will bring the Israelites into the land that I swore to give them, and I will be with you."
Moses finished writing all the words of this Law in a book.
He gave this command to the Levites who carried the Ark of Jehovah’s Covenant:
"Take this Book of the Law, and put it next to the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah your God, where it will be a witness against you.
"I know how rebellious you are. You are impossible to deal with. While I am alive and still with you, you are rebelling against Jehovah. How much more rebellious will you be after I die?
"Assemble all the elders of your tribes and your officers in front of me. As they listen, I will speak these words and call on heaven and earth to testify against them.
"I know that after I die you will become thoroughly corrupt and turn from the way I have commanded you to live. In the days to come disasters will happen to you because you will make Jehovah furious by doing what he considers evil."
The whole congregation of Israel listened. Moses recited all the words of this song:
"Give ear, O physical heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
"My instruction shall drop as the rain; my words shall descend like dew, as the gentle rains on the tender plant, and as the showers on vegetation.
"I will proclaim the name of Jehovah and ascribe greatness to our God.
"He is the Rock! His work is perfect. For all His ways are just. He is a God of faithfulness and without evil. He is just and upright.
"They have corrupted themselves; they are not His sons. They are a blemished, crooked and perverse generation.
"Is this how you repay Jehovah, you foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father and creator, who made you and formed you?
"Remember the days of old. Think about all the past generations. Ask your fathers to remind you, and your elders to tell you.
"When the Most High gave nations their inheritance, when he divided the descendants of Adam, he set up borders for the tribes corresponding to the number of the sons of Israel.
"Jehovah’s people were his property. Jacob was God’s own possession.
"He found his people in a desert land, in a barren place where animals howl. He guarded them, took care of them, and protected them because they were the precious apple pupil of his eye.
"Like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, spreads its wings to catch them, and carries them on its wings,
"Jehovah alone led his people. No foreign god was with them.
"He made him ride on the heights of the earth and fed him with the produce of the fields. He gave him honey from rocks and olive oil from solid rock.
"He ate cheese from cows and drank milk from sheep and goats. He gave them fat the best from the flock from lambs, rams from the stock of Bashan, male goats, and the best wheat. He drank the blood-red wine of grapes.
"Jeshurun Israel grew fat and disrespectful. You got fat! You were stuffed! You over eat! He abandoned the God who made him and scornfully treated the rock of his salvation.
"They made God furious because they worshiped foreign gods and angered him stirred up his zeal because they worshiped worthless idols.
"They sacrificed to demons that are not God. They served gods they did not know. These were new gods who came from nearby, gods your ancestors never worshiped.
"You ignored the rock that fathered you and forgot the God who gave you life.
"Jehovah saw this and rejected them. His own sons and daughters made him angry.
"He said: ‘ I will turn away from them and find out what will happen to them. They are a devious and perverse generation. They are children who have no faith.
"They made him furious because they worshiped foreign gods. They angered him because they worshiped worthless idols. So I will use those who are not my people to make them jealous and a nation of godless fools to make them angry.
My anger has started a fire that will burn into the depths of the grave. It will consume the earth and its crops and set the foundations of the mountains on fire.
"I will heap distress on them! I will use my arrows on them.
"They will be wasted by famine, and consumed by plague and bitter destruction. I will send teeth of wild animals on them, with the venom of crawling things reptiles of the dust.
"Outside the sword will bereave. Inside terror shall destroy both young man and virgin, babies and old man with gray hair.
"I would have said: ‘ I will cut them to pieces. I will remove the memory of them from men. ’
"I did not want their enemies to make me angry. I did not want their opponents to misunderstand and say: We won this victory! Jehovah did not do all this!
"My people have lost their good sense. They do not understand.
They fail to see why they were defeated. They cannot understand what happened.
"Why were a thousand defeated by one? Why ten thousand by only two? Jehovah their God abandoned them! Their mighty God gave them up.
"Their rock is not like our rock! Their enemies know that their own gods are weak, not mighty like Israel's God.
"Their vine is like the vine of Sodom. Their fields are like Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of anger. Their clusters are bitter.
"Their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of asps cobras.
"Is this not laid up in store with me and sealed up among my treasures?
"Vengeance and retribution belong to me. Vengeance is mine, I will repay. Their foot shall slide in time, for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things to come on them come quickly.
"Jehovah will bring his people justice. He will have compassion on his servants. He sees that their power is gone, and only the imprisoned and abandoned remain.
"He will say: ‘ Where are their gods, the rock in which they sought refuge?
"Who ate the fat of their sacrifices? Who drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you. Let them be your hiding place!
"See now that I, even I, am he. There is no god besides me! It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded and it is I who heals. There is no one who can deliver from my hand.
"Indeed, I lift up my hand to heaven, and say: As I live forever,
"I sharpen my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold on justice! I will render vengeance on my adversaries. I will repay those who hate me.
"I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword will devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the longhaired leaders of the enemy.
"Rejoice you nations with his people. He will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance on his adversaries, and will atone for his land and his people."
Then Moses came, along with Joshua son of Nun, and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
When Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
he said to them: "Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today. Command your sons to observe carefully all the words of this law.
"It is not an idle talk! Indeed it is your life. By this word you will prolong your days in the land you to possess on the other side of the Jordan."
Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day. He said:
"Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo. It is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho. Look at the land of Canaan. I am giving this to the sons of Israel for a possession.
"Then die on the mountain you climb. Be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
"You broke faith with me among the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin. You did not treat me as holy among of the sons of Israel.
"You will see the land at a distance, but you will not go into the land I am giving the sons of Israel."
These are the blessings that Moses, the man of God, pronounced on the people of Israel before he died:
"Jehovah came from Mount Sinai. He rose like the sun over Edom and shone on his people from Mount Paran. Ten thousand angels were with him. A flaming fire was at his right hand.
"Jehovah loves his people. All Your holy ones are in your hand. They followed in your steps and everyone receives your words.
"Moses commanded us with a law these teachings, a heritage of the assembly of Jacob.
"He was king in Jeshurun Israel when the leaders and all the tribes of the people of Israel were gathered.
"Do not let his men be few."
"Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people. With his hands he contended for them. May you Jehovah be help against his adversaries."
"Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to your godly man, whom you tested at Massah and with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.
"Who said of his father and mother: ‘ I have not seen them; and he did not acknowledge his brothers, nor did he regard his own sons. They observed your word and kept your covenant. ’
"They will teach your ordinances to Jacob, and your Law to Israel. They will burn incense before you, and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
"O Jehovah, bless his skills and accept the work of his hands. Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him and those who hate him, so that they will not rise again."
"May the beloved of Jehovah dwell in security by him who shields him all the day. He dwells between his shoulders."
"Blessed of Jehovah is his land. Bless it with the dew from heaven above and with the deep waters lying below.
"Bless with the choice yield of the sun, and with the bounty produced each month.
"Bless with the best things of the ancient mountains, and with the choice things of the everlasting hills.
"Bless with the choice things of the earth and its fullness. Let the favor of him who dwelt in the bush come to the head of Joseph and to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
"As the firstborn of his bulls, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild bull. With them he will push the peoples, all at once, to the ends of the earth. They are the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh."
"Rejoice Zebulun in your going out. And rejoice Issachar in your tents.
"They will call peoples to the mountain. There they will offer righteous sacrifices. They will draw out the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand."
"Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad. He lies down as a lion and tears the arm, also the crown of the head.
"He provided the first part for himself. There the ruler's portion was reserved. He came with the leaders of the people and executed his ordinance of Israel and the justice of Jehovah."
"Dan is a lion's cub. He leaps forth from Bashan."
"O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of Jehovah, take possession of the sea and the south."
"Asher is the most blessed with sons. May his brothers favor him. And may he dip his foot in oil.
"Your locks will be iron and bronze. According to your days, so will your leisurely walk be.
"There is none like the God of Jeshurun Israel. He rides the heavens to give you help. He goes through the skies in his majesty.
"The eternal God is a dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He drove out the enemy from before you, and said: ‘ Destroy! ’
"Israel dwells in security. The fountain of Jacob is secluded in a land of grain and new wine. His heavens also drop down dew.
"You are blessed O Israel. Who is like you, a people saved by Jehovah? He is the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you and you will tread upon their high places."
Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. Jehovah showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,
and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
Jehovah said: "This is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: I will give it to your descendants. I let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor. No man knows his burial place to this day.
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated.
So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. The sons of Israel listened to him and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face intimately,
for all the signs and wonders that Jehovah sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land,
and for all the great wonders and mighty power which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
The list of ancestors of Jesus Christ, descendant of David and Abraham:
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah and Tamar were the father and mother of Perez and Zerah. Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,
Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon.
Salmon and Rahab were the father and mother of Boaz. Boaz and Ruth were the father and mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse,
Jesse the father of King David. David and Uriah’s wife Bath-sheba were the father and mother of Solomon.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,
Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah.
Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. They lived at the time when the people were exiled to Babylon.
After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel,
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,
Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,
Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ the Anointed.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations from the exile until the Messiah.
The birth genesis: origin beginning of Jesus Christ was as follows: His mother Mary had been promised to Joseph in marriage. But before they were married, Mary realized that she was pregnant by Holy Spirit.
Her husband Joseph was an honorable man and did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to break the marriage agreement with her secretly.
Joseph had this in mind when God’s angel appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him: "Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant by Holy Spirit.
"She will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus "Jehovah is salvation", because he will save his people from their sins."
All this happened so that what God spoke through the prophet came true:
"The virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel," which means: "God God-like one is with us."
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of God had commanded him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.
He did not have marital relations with her before she gave birth to a son. Joseph named the child Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod. Astrologers arrived in Jerusalem from the east.
They asked: "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and came to offer him praise."
King Herod was troubled when he heard this. Jerusalem was also troubled.
He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law and asked where will the Messiah be born?
"Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. This is what the prophet wrote:
"Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you are not the least of the leading cities of Judah. A leader will come out of you. He will shepherd my people Israel."
Then Herod secretly called the astrologers to find out exactly the time the star appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said: "Search diligently for the young child. When you find him, bring me word so I may come and bow down to him also."
After they heard the king, they followed the star until it stopped over the place where the child was.
They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star.
They entered the house and saw the young child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and paid him homage. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
God warned the astrologers in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they departed for their country by a different road.
When they left, the angel of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: "Herod is looking to kill the young child. Arise, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to leave."
Joseph took the child and his mother to Egypt.
They did not return until the death of Herod. The words spoken by Jehovah through the prophet were fulfilled: "I called my son out of Egypt."
Herod saw that the astrologers tricked him and he was furious. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years old and younger in or near Bethlehem. This matched the time he learned from the astrologers.
Jeremiah’s prophecy came true:
"A sound was heard in Ramah, the sound of crying in bitter grief. Rachel is weeping for her children. She would not be comforted, because they were dead."
After Herod died God’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph who was in Egypt.
The angel told him: "Take the child and his mother and go to Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead."
Joseph took the child and his mother to Israel.
When he heard that Archelaus succeeded his father, Herod, as king of Judea, Joseph feared going. Warned in a dream, he left for Galilee instead.
He made his home in Nazareth. Thus the prophecy came true: "He Jesus will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming:
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."
Isaiah spoke of John when he said: "He is a voice shouting in the wilderness: ‘ Prepare the way of Jehovah. Make his paths straight. ’"
John wore clothes made from camel’s hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
People from Jerusalem, Judea, and the whole Jordan Valley went to him.
They confessed their sins and were baptized by John in the Jordan River.
He saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism. "You offspring of vipers," he said, "who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
"Bear fruit worthy of repentance!
"Do not presume that Abraham is your father. I tell you that God can make descendants for Abraham from these stones!
"The ax is ready to cut down the trees at the roots. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water because of your repentance. He that comes after me is mightier than I. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and fire. I am not even good enough to carry his sandals.
"His winnowing shovel is in his hand. He will clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into a barn. He will then burn the husks in a fire that cannot be put out."
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
"I need to be baptized by you," John said. "Why are you coming to me?"
Jesus answered emphatically: "This is the proper way to do everything that God requires. This is the way it must be!"
Then Jesus was baptized and came up from the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened. He saw God’s Spirit coming down like a dove.
Then a voice from heaven said: "This is my Son whom I love and whom I have approved."
God’s Spirit led Jesus into the desert wilderness. There he was tested tempted by the Devil.
He fasted forty days and nights, and was very hungry.
Satan, the Tempter, said to him: "If since you are the Son of God order these stones to turn into bread."
In reply Jesus answered: "It is written; man shall not live on bread alone, but on all everything every word every utterance every declaration that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah."
Then the Devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on top of the Temple.
"If since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. The Scriptures say: ‘ God will give orders to his angels about you and they will hold you with their hands, so that not even your feet will strike the ground. ’"
"Again it is written," Jesus replied, "‘ you must not put Jehovah your God to the test. ’"
This time the Devil took Jesus to an extremely high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world with all their greatness.
"I will give all this to you," the Devil told Jesus, "if you kneel down and worship me."
"Go away, Satan!" demanded Jesus. "It is written, "It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service. ’"
Then the Devil left Jesus, and the angels came and served him.
Jesus heard that John had been arrested. So Jesus withdrew to Galilee.
He left Nazareth to reside at Capernaum, a town by Lake Galilee, in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus the prophecy revealed to Isaiah would be fulfilled:
"O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!
"the people sitting in darkness saw a great light. Light rose upon those sitting in a region of deathly shadow."
From that time on Jesus preached this message: "Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is near."
Jesus walked on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother. They were fishermen.
He said to them: "Follow me and I will teach you to catch people."
At once they abandoned their nets and followed him.
He saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.
Instantly they left the boat and their father, and went with him.
Jesus walked all over Galilee teaching in the synagogues. He preached the Good News about the Kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.
News about him spread throughout the country of Syria. People sick and suffering from diseases, people with demons, epileptics and paralytics, came to him. Jesus healed them all.
Because of this, large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the land on the other side of the Jordan.
Seeing great masses of people, he went up to the mountain. When he was seated his disciples came to him.
He opened his mouth and taught them:
"Blessed Greek: makarios: happy, blessed are those conscious of their spiritual need, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
"Blessed are the meek gentle mild humble, for they will inherit the earth.
"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
"Blessed are the merciful and compassionate, for they will receive mercy and compassion.
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.
"Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.
"Rejoice, and be filled with joy, for great is your reward in heaven. The prophets, who came before you, were also persecuted.
"You are the salt of the earth. If its taste goes away, how will you restore it? It is good for nothing. All you can do is throw it on the ground and walk on it.
"You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill may be seen by all.
"A light is not placed under a cover. To the contrary, it is placed on a table so all may see.
"Likewise, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.
"Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill perfect execute accomplish.
"I solemnly tell you, heaven and earth would pass away before one small letter detail will pass away from the Law. All things must be accomplished.
"Whoever disobeys even the least of the commandments and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. On the other hand whoever obeys and teaches others to obey the Law will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
"I also tell you, your righteousness must be greater than the scribes and Pharisees or you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
"You were told in the past, do not murder kill. Any one who murders will be brought to trial.
"Now I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be guilty before the court. Whoever speaks to his brother with words of contempt shall receive condemnation before the Sanhedrin Supreme Court. Curse your brother and you will be guilty enough to be destroyed by fire, with the burning trash, at the Valley of Hinnom, outside of Jerusalem Greek: Gehenna.
"When making an offering at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you,
"leave your gift at the altar and go make peace with your brother. Then return and make your offering.
"Come to an agreement quickly with the one who has a legal case against you. Do it before he turns the case over to the judge and you are thrown into jail.
"Take it from me; you will stay in jail until you pay the very last penny of your fine.
"You have heard it was said, ‘ You should not commit adultery. ’
"However, I tell you that whoever looks at a woman with lustful thoughts commits adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away! It is better to lose a part of your body then to have your whole body destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom.
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose part of your body, than for your whole body to be destroyed in the ever-burning fire. Figuratively: lose prospect for everlasting life; ever-burning fire means total destruction.
"Again, it was said, ‘ Whoever gets rid of his wife has to give her a certificate of divorce. ’
"I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for the reason of fornication, makes her liable to commit adultery. And if she marries again, the man she marries also commits adultery.
"You were also told that you should keep a promise oath. Always keep your promises vows to Jehovah.
"I tell you, offer no promises at all, not by heaven, because it is God’s throne.
"Not by earth, for it is the footstool under His feet. Not by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
"And do not promise by your head, for you cannot even control the hair on your head.
"Let your answer be ‘ Yes’ or ‘ No. ’ ’ Anything more than this is from the evil one.
"You have heard it said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
"But I tell you, do not resist a wicked person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to that person.
"If someone takes you to court to sue you and takes your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
"Whoever makes you go one mile, go with him two.
"Give to those who ask. Lend to those who borrow.
"You have heard it said, ‘ You should love your neighbor and hate your enemy. ’
"I say love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!
"You will then act as true children of your Father in heaven. He gives sunlight to both evil and good people. He sends rain for the just and the unjust.
"What good is there, when you love only those who love you? Even corrupt tax collectors do that!
"When you are kind only to your friends and brothers what makes you different from anyone else? Even people of the nations do that.
"Be perfect mature, even as your Father in heaven is perfect mature.
"Be careful! Do not display your righteousness good works before men to be noticed by them. If you do, you will have no reward with your heavenly Father.
"Do not loudly announce it when you give to the poor. The hypocrites do this in the houses of worship and on the streets. They do this to be praised by men. Believe me, they have already been paid in full.
"When you give gifts, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
"Your giving will be in secret and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
"Do not pray like the hypocrites! They want everyone to see them in the houses of worship and on the street corners. I assure you they have been paid in full.
"Go to your room and close the door. Privately pray to your Father. When your Father sees you he will reward you.
"Large quantities of meaningless words and repetition are not acceptable in prayer. The pagans think their gods will hear long and repetitious prayers.
"Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
"‘ Our Father in heaven, holy is your name.
"‘ Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
"‘ Give us this day our daily bread.
"‘ Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
"‘ And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil the wicked one. ’
"If you forgive others their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
"If you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.
"When you abstain from food, do not be like the hypocrites, with sad faces to be seen by men. They have received their reward.
"Anoint your head and wash your face.
"That way, men may not see that you are fasting. Your Father knows in secret and will reward you.
"Do not accumulate large amounts of wealth on earth. This is where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.
"Accumulate wealth in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart will be where you keep your wealth.
"The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eye is clear simple focused single minded, your whole body will be full of spiritual light.
"But if your eye is wicked, your body will be in darkness. If that light in you is really darkness, how great a darkness it must be.
"You cannot serve two masters. You will hate one and love the other. You will be loyal to one master and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money wealth material possessions.
"I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. And do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is life worth more than food? And is the body worth more than clothes?
"Look at the birds of the sky, they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you worth more than they?
"Can you live longer by worrying about it?
"Why are you worried about clothing? Look at how the lilies of the field grow. They do not toil. They do not spin.
"I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like these.
"If God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, won ’ t he care for you even more? You of little faith!
"Do not worry! Do not say: ‘ What shall we eat? ’ ’ or, ‘ What shall we drink? ’ ’ or, ‘ What shall we wear? ’
"All people go in search of these things. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
"Seek desire require serve first the kingdom of God and his righteousness continuously and all these things will be added to you.
"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will have its own worries. Sufficient for each day is its own badness.
"Stop judging, so that you will not be judged.
"As you judge, so you will be judged. As you measure, it will be measured to you.
"Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye? Do you not consider the beam in your own eye?
"Will you tell your brother, ‘ I will remove the speck from your eye ’ ’ when there is a beam in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye. Then you can see to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.
"Do not give holy things to the dogs impure persons false prophets. Do not throw your pearls before swine the most unclean. They will trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces.
"Ask and it will be given you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened for you.
"Everyone who asks receives. Everyone who seeks finds, and everyone who knocks will have it opened.
"Who among you, who would give his son a stone when he asks him for bread?
"Who will give him a serpent when he asks for a fish?
"Even though you are a sinner, you know how to give good gifts to your children. Think how much more your Father in heaven gives good things to those who ask him!
"Do for others the same as you would have them to do for you. That is the meaning of the Law and the Prophets.
"Enter through the narrow gate, since the gate to destruction is wide and the road that leads to destruction is wide and many enter through it.
"Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way to life. Only a few put forth the effort. Yes, only a few people enter the narrow gate.
"Watch out for the false prophets. They are disguised as sheep. But in their hearts they are vicious wolves.
"By their fruits you will know them. Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?
"Every good tree gives righteous fruit. The bad tree gives evil fruit.
"A good tree does not give bad fruit. A bad tree does not give good fruit.
"Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"Therefore by their fruits you will know them.
"Not everyone who calls me Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven. He who does the will of my Father in heaven will enter.
"Many will say to me in that day, ‘ Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? ’
"I will say to them, ‘ I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of evil. ’
"Everyone who hears my words, and does them is like a wise man that builds his house on a rock.
"The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it did not fall. It was built on a solid rock foundation.
"Every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.
"The rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and battered the house and it fell with a great crash."
When Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at what he taught.
He taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
A leper came to him and bowed down before him, saying: "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."
He reached out his hand and touched him, saying: "I want to. Be made clean." Right away his leprosy was cleansed.
Jesus told him not to tell anyone. "Show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
When he entered Capernaum, a centurion captain of one hundred men approached him.
He said: "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home and terribly tormented."
Jesus said to him: "I will come and heal him."
The centurion replied to Jesus: "Lord, I am not worthy that you come under my roof. Say the word and my servant will be healed.
"I also am a man having authority and commanding soldiers. I say to this one, ‘ Go, ’ ’ and he goes; and to another, ‘ Come, ’ ’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘ Do this, ’ ’ and he does it."
When Jesus heard it, he was amazed, and said to the crowd: "I tell you, I have not found such great faith in Israel.
"I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:
"but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Jesus said to the centurion: "Go. Just as you believe, so it will be done to you." The servant was healed in that hour.
Jesus went to Peter’s house. He saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.
He touched her hand and the fever left her. She arose, and ministered to him.
That evening, they brought many people possessed with demons to him. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick.
In so doing, that which was spoken through Isaiah was fulfilled. Isaiah wrote: "He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases."
Now when Jesus saw how large the crowd was growing, he gave orders to depart to the other side of the lake.
A scribe came to him and said: "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus replied: "Foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head."
One of his disciples said: "Lord, first allow me to go bury my father."
But Jesus said to him: "Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
When he entered a boat, his disciples followed him.
Suddenly a storm blew in and the boat was covered with waves. Jesus was asleep.
And they came to him, woke him, and cried: "Save us, Lord, or we will perish."
He said to them: "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. Suddenly there was a great calm.
The disciples were in awe. They asked: "What kind of man is this, for even the winds and the sea obey him?"
When he arrived at the other side of the lake in the country of the Gadarenes two men possessed by demons came to him from out of the tombs. They were extremely violent, so no man could pass by that way.
They screamed at him, saying: "What have we to do with you, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the time?"
A large herd of swine was feeding in the distance.
The demons pleaded with him: "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine!"
He told them to go. And they came out, and went into the swine. The entire herd rushed down the hill into the sea, where they perished in the waters.
The herdsmen fled to the city to tell everything that happened to the swine that were possessed with demons.
Everyone in the city came out to meet Jesus. They begged him to go away from their country.
Jesus entered a boat and crossed over to his own city Capernaum, on the other side of the lake.
A man on a bed, a paralytic, was brought to Jesus. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the sick man: "Have courage; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scribes said among themselves: "This man has no respect for God."
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said: "Why are your thoughts evil?
"Which is easier, to say, your sins are forgiven, or to say, get up and walk?"
So that you know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he turned and spoke to the paralytic or paralyzed man: "Get up, take your bed and go to your house."
He arose, and departed to his house.
But when the people saw it, they marveled, and glorified God who had given such authority to men.
Jesus moved on. He then saw Matthew seated at his work collecting taxes. He said to him: "Follow me." He rose and followed him.
Jesus was a dinner guest at Matthew’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw it, they asked his disciples: "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?"
When he heard it, he said: "People who are well do not have need of a physician. The sick do.
"You should learn what this means: ‘ I desire mercy, and not sacrifice ’; for I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners."
The disciples of John asked: "Why do your disciples not fast?" They frequently fasted, and so did the Pharisees.
Jesus replied: "Should the wedding guests mourn and also celebrate with the groom? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.
"Why patch an old garment with cloth that has not been shrunk? The patch shrinks and pulls away from the old cloth leaving a big hole.
"Neither do men put new wine in old wineskins. The skins burst and the wine is lost. They put new wine in fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
While he was speaking, an official came and paid him respect. He said: "By now my daughter must be dead. Come and lay your hand on her and she will live."
Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.
A woman who had a hemorrhage chronic flow of blood for twelve years came behind him. She touched the border of his garment.
She said to herself: "If I touch his garment, I will be healed."
Jesus turned to see her and said: "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." The woman was healed at that time.
Jesus went into the official’s house and saw flute players and the crowd making a lot of noise.
He told them to leave: "For the girl is not dead, but sleeps." They all scornfully laughed at him.
The people were sent away. He went to the girl, took hold of her hand, and she got up.
The news about this spread to all the land.
Jesus left that place and walked along the road. Two blind men followed him. They shouted: "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
He went into a nearby house. The blind men followed him. Jesus asked them: "Do you believe that I can heal you?" They said: "Yes Lord."
He touched their eyes. "Let it be done," he said, "according to your faith."
Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly warned them: "Do not let anyone know about this."
They spread the news about Jesus all over that part of the country.
Next, a dumb man possessed with a demon was brought to him.
When the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd marveled, saying: "We have never seen anything like this in Israel!"
The Pharisees complained: "He casts out demons with the help of the ruler of the demons."
Jesus went to all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom. He healed every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.
When he saw the large crowds of people, he was moved with compassion for them. He knew they were distressed and scattered like sheep not having a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.
"Pray that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers into his harvest."
He called his twelve disciples. He gave them power to cast out unclean spirits and to heal all kinds of disease and sickness.
The following are the names of the twelve apostles ambassadors of the good news messengers: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.
Jesus sent the twelve. He gave them orders not to go to the people of the nations and not to go to the Samaritans.
He said: "Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
"Preach as you go! Announce the kingdom of heaven, for it is near.
"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. You received without paying, now give without being paid.
"Do not take gold, silver, or copper money in your money belt.
"Take no extra clothes, not even two coats, no extra shoes or walking stick for the laborer is worthy of his food.
"Go into a city or village and search for the worthy ones. Stay with them until you are ready to leave.
"When you enter the house, offer a blessing of peace.
"If the people are worthy, let your blessing stand. If they are not worthy, let your peace return to you.
"If someone will not welcome you and listen to the message, leave that house or town, shake the dust off your feet and move on.
"I tell you, it will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that town.
"I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
"Beware of men! They will take you to court! They will have you beaten in their meeting places.
"You will be taken before governors and kings for my sake. This will serve as a testimony to them and to the people of the nations.
"When they hand you over, do not worry about what to say and how to say it. You will be given the words to speak at that time.
"You will not speak on your own. Your Father’s Spirit will speak through you.
"People will hand over their brothers to be put to death. Parents will oppose children and children will oppose parents, causing them to be put to death.
"Men will hate you because of me. He who endures to the end will be saved.
"When they persecute you in this city, flee to the next. I tell you; before you have gone through all the cities of Israel the Son of man will come.
"A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant his master.
"It is enough for the disciple student that he is like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub Satan, others of the household could also be called the same!
"Do not be afraid. Nothing will be hidden. Every secret will be made known.
"The things I tell you in darkness, speak in the light. Proclaim everything you hear from on top of the house.
"Do not fear those who kill the body. They are not able to take away your everlasting life. Instead, fear him who is able to destroy both life and body in the ever-burning fires. Greek: Gehenna: continuously burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom.
"Do two sparrows sell for a penny? Not one of them will fall on the ground without your Father knowing.
"Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
"Do not fear! You are more valuable than many sparrows.
"I will tell my heavenly Father about everyone who confesses me witnesses to others about me before men.
"I will deny, before my heavenly Father, anyone who denies me before men.
"Do not think I came to bring peace on the earth. I came not to bring peace, but a sword.
"My coming will cause a separation. A man will be against his father and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
"A man’s enemies will be from his own family.
"He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. He who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"Anyone who does not pick up his stake and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds his life will lose it. Whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
"Anyone who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. Anyone who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.
"And whoever gives a drink of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will not lose his reward."
When Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left to teach and preach in their cities.
While in prison, John heard news of what Christ was doing. He sent his disciples.
They asked Jesus: "Are you the Expected One or should we look for another?"
And Jesus answered: "Go tell John the things you hear and see.
"The blind receive their sight. The lame walk! The lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear. The dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
"Blessed and happy is he who is not offended by me."
When these men left, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. "What did you go into the wilderness to find? Did you look for a reed shaken by the wind?
"What did you expect to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Those who wear fancy clothes are in king’s houses.
"Did you go to see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet!
"This is he of whom it is written: ‘ Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare the way for you. ’
"I tell you, there is none, born of women, greater then John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been man’s goal, and men of violence have attempted to take it by force.
"For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
"If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.
"He who has ears to hear let him listen!
"Of what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their playmates.
"They say: ‘ We piped for you and you did not dance. We cried and you did not mourn. ’
"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘ He has a demon. ’
"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘ A gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! ’ ’ Wisdom is justified by its actions."
Then he denounced the cities where most of his mighty works were done, because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon that were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
"I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment than for you.
"Will you, Capernaum, be exalted into heaven? You will go down into the grave. If the mighty works had been done in Sodom, which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
"But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment, than for you."
Then Jesus prayed: "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have revealed them to children.
"Yes, Father, for it was very pleasing in your sight.
"All things have been delivered to me from my Father. Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father. The Son tells others about the Father so that they can know him too.
"Come unto me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me. I am meek mild and humble in heart. You will have a restful life,
"for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
Jesus’ disciples were hungry. It was Sabbath day and yet Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields plucking ears and eating them.
The Pharisees saw it and said to him: "Your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
He replied to them: "Have you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
"He entered into the house of God, and he and his companions ate the showbread holy bread, which it was not lawful for them to eat. It was only lawful for the priests.
"Have you read the law that on the Sabbath day the priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
"I say to you, one greater than the Temple is here.
"If you had known what this means, ‘ I desire mercy and not sacrifice, ’ ’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.
"For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath."
He left and went into their synagogue.
There he saw a man who had a withered hand. They asked him if it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? They wanted to accuse him.
He said to them: "Which of you having one sheep, if this sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not get it and lift it out.
"How much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day!"
Then he said to the man: "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out and it was restored whole like the other.
The Pharisees left and took counsel against him, to decide how they might destroy him.
Jesus was aware of this and withdrew from the place. Many followed him and were healed by him.
He warned them not to tell anyone where he was.
This fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet.
"Look! My servant whom I have chosen. I am well pleased with him. I will put my Spirit upon him and he will declare judgment to the nations.
"He will not quarrel, nor cry aloud. None will hear his voice in the streets.
"He will break a bruised reed. He will quench smoking flax. This he will do until he sends forth judgment to victory.
"The nations will hope in his name!"
Someone possessed with a demon, blind and dumb was brought to him. He healed him and the dumb man spoke and could see.
The crowds were amazed, and said: "Can this be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard it, they said: "This man casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of the demons."
Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed. Every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How will his kingdom stand?
"If I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Let them be your judges.
"But if I cast out demons by God’s Spirit, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
"How can one enter into the house of a strong man and steal his things, except he first tie up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.
"He that is not with me is against me. And he that does not gather with me, scatters.
"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men. But the blasphemy against God’s Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.
"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt. The fruit a tree produces provides its reputation.
"You offspring of vipers. How can you who are evil speak good things? Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
"The good man performs good things out of his good treasure. The evil man performs evil things out of his evil treasure.
"I tell you there will be an account in the Judgment Day for every careless word that men say.
"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered them: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign. No sign will be given but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
"Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the huge fish, so the Son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the grave.
"The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it. After all, they repented at the preaching of Jonah. Yet someone greater than Jonah is here.
"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it. She came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon. Someone greater than Solomon is here!
"When an unclean spirit goes out of a man it passes through the desert seeking rest. It does not find it.
"It tries to return to the place from where it came. It finds it empty, swept, and fixed up.
"Then it takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. It will also be like this with this evil generation."
While Jesus was yet speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers stood nearby. They wanted to speak to him.
Someone told Jesus: "Look, your mother and your brothers stand nearby seeking to speak to you."
But he answered: "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said: "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
"For everyone who does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother."
That day Jesus left the house and sat by the seashore.
Large crowds gathered to him. He entered a boat while the crowd stood on the shore.
He told them many illustrations. He said: "A farmer went out to sow.
"Some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds devoured them.
"Others fell on rocky places and did not have much soil.
"When they grew, the sun scorched them, and because they had no root they withered and died.
"Others fell upon the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.
"Some fell on good ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
"He that has ears let him hear."
The disciples asked him: "Why do you speak in illustrations?"
He responded: "You are allowed to know the divine secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it is not for others to know. The Greek word for "you" is plural and is applied to the disciples as a group.
"He who has shall receive more to the point of abundance. He who does not have, it shall be taken away including that which he has.
"I speak to them in illustrations stories parables allegories, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear. They just do not understand.
"The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled. ‘ By hearing, you shall hear, and shall in no way understand. By seeing you shall see, and shall in no way perceive.
"‘ The heart of this people is callous and dull. Their ears are plugged. They cannot hear. They closed their eyes and cannot see. They cannot see nor hear nor understand with their heart. They should turn around and I would heal them. ’
"Happy and blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
"Truly, I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see, and could not see them. They also desired to hear the things that you hear, and could not hear them.
"Listen to the illustration of the sower.
"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one takes away that which was sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.
"Anyone sown among the rocky places hears the word and immediately with joy receives it.
"There is no root in him. He endures for a while. When he has tribulation or persecution because of the word, he falls away.
"He that was sown among thorns hears the word. The cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
"He that was sown upon the good ground hears the word, and understands it. He bears fruit, producing sometimes a hundredfold, sometimes sixty, and sometimes thirty."
He told another illustration, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man that sowed good seed in his field.
"While he slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds with the wheat, and went away.
"When the blade sprouted and brought forth fruit, it looked like wheat.
"The servants of the householder said to him: ‘ Sir, did you sow good seed in your field? Why does it have weeds mixed in with the good wheat? ’
"He replied: ‘ An enemy did this. ’ ’ The servants offered to remove the weeds.
"He said: ‘ No, you might uproot the wheat with them.
"‘ Let both grow together until the harvest. In the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: "Gather weeds first, and bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat into my barn." ’"
In another illustration Jesus said: "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man sowed in his field.
"Mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. Yet when it grows it becomes as large as a tree. In fact the birds of heaven lodge in the branches."
He offered another illustration: "The kingdom of heaven is similar to leaven. A woman hid leaven in three measures of meal until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke with illustrations to the crowds. He did not speak anything without using illustrations.
That which was spoken through the prophet was fulfilled, saying: "I will open my mouth in illustrations. I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."
Then he left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples gathered near him. They said: "Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field."
Jesus said: "He that sows the good seed is the Son of man.
"The field is the world the society of mankind. The good seed are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one.
"The enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age. The reapers are angels.
"The weeds are gathered up and burned destroyed with fire. It will be this way at the end of the age.
"The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all who stumble others and commit lawlessness.
"The angels will cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"The righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears let him hear.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found the treasure and hid it again in the field. He is so filled with joy he sells everything he owns and buys the field.
"The kingdom of heaven is also like a merchant seeking valuable pearls.
"When he found one pearl of great value, he sold all that he had, and bought it.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea. It gathered fish of every kind.
"They drew it up on the beach when it was full. They gathered the good into containers and threw away the bad.
"It will be that way at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
"The wicked will be cast into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Have you understood all these things?" They said to him: "Yes."
And he said to them: "Every scribe journalist writer who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
After Jesus finished telling these illustrations, he left.
He went to his own country and taught in the synagogue. They were astonished and asked where this man got this wisdom and these mighty works.
"Is this man the carpenter’s son? Is his mother called Mary? Are his brothers James and Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Are his sisters all with us? Where did he get all these things?"
They resented him. But Jesus responded to them: "A prophet is without honor in his own country, and in his own house."
He did not do many mighty works there because of their lack of faith.
At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard the news about Jesus.
He told his servants: "This is John the Baptist, raised from the dead. That explains the power working in him."
Herod locked John in prison to please Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
For John had said to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to put him to death but he feared the people since they believed John was a prophet.
It was Herod’s birthday. The daughter of Herodias danced for him and pleased him.
So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted.
Prompted by her mother, she said: "Give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter."
The king was grieved. He gave his oath and many were watching so he commanded that it be done.
He gave the order to behead John in prison.
His head was brought on a platter to the young lady. She in turn gave it to her mother.
John the Baptist’s disciples took the corpse and buried him, and then came and told Jesus.
When Jesus heard it, he left in a boat to a secluded place. The crowds heard this and followed him on foot from the cities.
He saw the great crowd, had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
Evening came and the disciples approached Jesus and said: "This place is desolate. Send the people away so they may go to the villages and buy themselves food."
Jesus told them: "They have no need to go away: you feed them."
They remarked: "We have only five loaves, and two fishes."
"Bring them to me," Jesus replied.
He commanded the crowd to sit down on the grass. Then he prayed. He gave the five loaves and two fishes to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.
And they all had plenty to eat. In fact they had twelve baskets full of food left over.
About five thousand men, plus women and children ate.
Jesus sent the disciples in a boat to the other side of the sea. He stayed there until he sent the crowd away.
After sending the crowd away, he went to the mountain to pray by himself. He was there alone that night.
But the boat was now in the middle of the sea. The wind and the waves caused great trouble.
Just before morning, Jesus walked to them on the water.
When they saw him walking on the water they were troubled. "It is a spirit apparition illusion!" they screamed! They cried out with fear.
At once Jesus said: "It is I; do not be afraid."
Peter said to him: "Lord, if it is you, give me the order to come to you on the water."
He said: "Come." Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
When he noticed how strong the wind was, he became afraid. He began to sink, and cried: "Help me Lord!"
Suddenly, Jesus put out his hand and took hold of him, and said: "You of little faith, why were you in doubt?"
The wind went down when they got into the boat.
Those on the boat loved him intensely, saying: "Truly, you are the Son of God!"
They came to land at Gennesaret.
When the men of that place heard the news about Jesus they told everyone in the country. The sick were taken to him.
They wanted to touch his robe to be made well.
Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus.
They questioned him: "Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers? They eat food with unwashed hands."
His answer to them was in the form of a question: "Why do you go against the word of God in favor of your tradition?
"God said, ‘ Honor your father and mother. ’ ’ ‘ He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death. ’
"You teach that a man should tell his father or mother that what he has that could help them, is given to God.
"You say there is no need for him to give honor to his father. You have invalidated the word of God because of your tradition!
"You hypocrites liars! Isaiah’s prophecy was right about you.
"‘ These people honor me with their lips, but their heart innermost thoughts is far from me.
"‘ But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules commands of men. ’"
He got the people together and said to them: "Listen, and let my words be clear to you.
"That which comes out of the mouth makes a man unclean, not that which goes into the mouth."
The disciples told him the Pharisees were upset by what he said.
In answer he replied: "Every plant my Father in heaven has not planted in the earth will be pulled out by the roots.
"Let them be. They are blind guides. If a blind man guides another blind man, they will fall in a hole together."
Then Peter said to him: "Make the story clear to us."
He replied: "Are you, like them, without wisdom?
"Do you not see, that which goes into the mouth, goes into the stomach and is sent out as waste?
"That which comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart and makes a man unclean.
"Evil thoughts come from the heart! Thoughts about murder, adultery, fornication, theft, lying, and slander come from the heart!
"These things make a man unclean. Eating food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean."
Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon.
A woman of Canaan came crying and saying: "Have pity on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit."
He did not answer her. His disciples said to him: "Send her away; she keeps shouting at us."
He answered: "I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel."
She bowed down before him and asked for help.
He said: "It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, Lord; but even the dogs take the scraps from under their masters’ table."
"O woman," Jesus replied, "your faith is great! Let your desire be done." And her daughter was made well from that hour.
Jesus went from there to the Sea of Galilee. He went up into the mountain and sat down.
Many people came to him. They brought those who were lame, crippled, blind, mute, and many other people. They laid them down at his feet and he healed them.
The people marveled as they saw the mute speak, the crippled and lame walk, and the blind see. They glorified the God of Israel.
Jesus called his disciples and said: "I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way."
The disciples replied: "Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?"
Jesus asked: "How many loaves do you have?" They said: "Seven, and a few small fish."
He told the people to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and offered a prayer of thanksgiving. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. The disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. When they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, there were seven large baskets full.
Four thousand men, besides women and children were fed.
After dismissing the crowds, Jesus took a boat to the region of Magadan.
The Pharisees and Sadducees tested Jesus by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
He said to them, "At nightfall you say the weather will be good, for the sky is red.
"And in the morning, the weather will be bad today for the sky is red and angry. You are able to see the face of heaven, but not the signs of the time.
"An evil and false generation is searching after a sign. However, no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah." Then he left them.
The disciples came from the other side of the sea. They did not think to obtain bread.
Jesus said: "Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
They reasoned among themselves, saying: "We took no bread."
Hearing this, Jesus said: "You of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves about not having bread?
"Do you still not see or remember the five cakes of bread of the five thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?
"Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?
"Why do you not understand I was not talking about bread? Instead, about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?"
Then they realized it was not the leaven of bread he had in mind. It was the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Jesus traveled to parts of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples: "Who do men say that the Son of man is?"
They said: "John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
Jesus answered him: "Bless you, Simon son of John. This knowledge came from my Father in heaven and not from man.
"You are Peter Greek: petros: piece of rock, and on this rock-mass Greek: petra: mass of rock referring to Jesus I will build my congregation. The entrance to the grave Greek: Hades will not have power to stop it.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is improper and unlawful in heaven, and whatever you declare lawful on earth must be lawful in heaven."
He gave orders to the disciples to tell no man he was the Christ.
From that time forward Jesus made it clear to his disciples how he would have to go to Jerusalem. He told them he would undergo much at the hands of the authorities, including the chief priests and scribes. He let them know he would be put to death. The third day he would come back from the dead.
Peter protested and rebuked Jesus. He said: "Do not think of that, Lord; it will never happen to you."
He turned to Peter and said: "Get behind me, Satan. You are a stumbling block to me. You think the things of men, not of God."
Then Jesus told his disciples: "If any man wants to follow me be mine, let him deny disown himself, and take up his stake and follow me Greek: akoloutheo moi, let him be following me accompany me be in the same way with me.
"He who wants to save his life will lose it. He who is willing to lose his life for my sake will find it.
"What will a man profit, if he gains the whole world, and gives up his life? What will a man give in exchange for his life?
"The Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels. He will then reward each man according to his deeds.
"I tell you truly, there are some that stand here who will not experience death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother up into a high mountain alone.
While they watched, Jesus’ appearance changed transformed transfigured in their presence. His face was as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
Moses and Elijah appeared, and they were talking to him.
Peter told Jesus: "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud, saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces. They were very afraid.
Jesus touched them and told them to get up and not be afraid.
They saw only Jesus when they opened their eyes.
When they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what they saw, until the Son of man has risen from the dead.
His disciples asked him: "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
In answer he said: "Elijah truly has to come and put all things right.
"I tell you that Elijah has come. They did not know him and treated him badly as they pleased. They will do the same with the Son of man."
Then the disciples saw that he was telling them about John the Baptist.
When they approached the people, a man fell to his knees before him, saying:
"Lord, have mercy on my son. He has mental problems and is in great pain. He frequently falls into the fire and into the water.
"I took him to your disciples, and they were not able to make him well."
Jesus answered: "You unbelieving and perverted generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me."
Jesus ordered the unclean spirit to leave the boy. It left him and the boy was made well immediately.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: "Why were we not able to send it out?"
He told them: "It was because of your lack of faith: Truly I say to you, if you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move and it will move. Nothing will be impossible to you."
While they were traveling in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men.
"They will put him to death. The third day he will be raised from death." They were very sad.
They arrived at Capernaum. The collectors of the two-drachma tax asked Peter: "Does your master make payment of the Temple tax?
He said: "Yes." When he entered the house, Jesus said to him: "What is your opinion, Simon? Who pays the tax assessed by the kings of the earth? Is it from their sons or from other people?"
When he said: "From other people," Jesus replied: "Are the sons free of tax?
"We will not cause them trouble. Go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish you catch. You will see money a stater coin in its mouth. Give it to them for me and for you."
In that hour the disciples came to Jesus. They asked: "Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
He took a little child and put him in the middle of them.
He said: "Truly I tell you, if you do not have a change of heart and become like little children, you will not go into the kingdom of heaven.
"He who humbles himself to become like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Everyone who accepts this little child in my name accepts me.
"He who causes one of my faithful little ones to stumble is in trouble. It would be better for him to end up in the deep sea with a great stone tied to his neck.
"A curse is on the earth because of stumbling! It is necessary for stumbling to come. Unhappy is that man through whom the stumbling comes.
"If your hand or your foot is a cause of stumbling cut it off. Get rid of it. It is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than, having two hands or two feet, to be destroyed by eternal fire.
"If your eye causes you stumbling, take it out and throw it away. It is better for you to go into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to be destroyed in ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna.
"Do not treat these little ones badly. I tell you that angels represent them in the presence of my Father in heaven.
"What do you think? A man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone wandering away. Will he leave the ninety-nine and go in search of the wandering one?
"When he finds it, I tell you he will be filled with more joy than he would have if he had stayed with the ninety-nine.
"Even so, your Father in heaven does not want any of these little ones to be lost.
"If your brother does wrong to you, go to him in private. Clearly explain his error between you and him. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother back.
"If he does not listen to you, take one or two more people with you. Two or three witnesses may prove every case.
"If he will not listen to them, let it come to the attention of the congregation. If he will not listen to the congregation, let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector.
"I tell you; whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be declared improper and unlawful in heaven. Whatever you make free on earth will be declared lawful in heaven.
"Again, I say to you, that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst."
Peter came to him and said: "Lord, How many times may my brother do wrong against me, and I forgive him? Seven times?"
Jesus said to him: "Not seven times; but seventy times seven.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who went over his accounts with his servants.
"First, one came to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
"He was not able to make payment. So his lord gave orders for him to be sold. His wife, sons, and daughters were all to be sold along with every possession. The money would be used for payment of what he owed.
"So the servant fell on his face out of respect. He said: ‘ Lord, give me time to make payment and I will pay everything. ’
"Being moved with pity, the lord let him go, and made him free of the debt.
"Then that servant met another servant who was in debt to him for one hundred denarii. He took him by the throat, saying, ‘ Pay your debt now. ’
"That servant fell down before him, saying, ‘ Give me time and I will make payment to you. ’
"He would not give him time. He put him into prison till he paid the debt.
"When the other servants saw what happened, they were very sad. They told their lord what had been done.
"His lord sent for him, and said: ‘ Evil servant; I made you free of all that debt, because of your request to me.
"‘ Should you also show mercy to your fellow servant the same way I showed mercy to you? ’
"His lord was angry and sent him to jail to be punished until he paid back all of his debt.
"My heavenly Father will treat you like that if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
When Jesus finished speaking, he departed from Galilee. He went to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him, and he healed many of them.
Pharisees came to him. They tested him, asking: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
He answered: "Have you not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female?
"For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. The two shall become one flesh.
"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What God has joined together, let no man pull apart separate!"
They asked him: "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, to send her away?"
He answered: "Moses allowed you to send your wives away because of your hardness of heart. It was not allowed from the beginning.
"I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. And he who marries her when she is divorced, commits adultery."
The disciples said to him: "This being the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry."
He said: "This does not apply to everyone, only to those God has given it to.
"For there are men who, from birth, were without sex. There are some who were made that way by men. There are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this let him accept it."
Then some people brought little children to him. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples tried to stop them.
Jesus said: "Let the little ones children come to me. Do not keep them away: for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He put his hands on them, and then went on his way.
One man said: "Master, what good thing must I do, so that I may have eternal life?"
Jesus answered him: "Why are you questioning me about what is good? There is one who is good. If you desire life, obey the Law."
The man replied: "Which law?" And Jesus said: "Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false witness,
"Honor your father and your mother, and Love your neighbor as yourself."
The man said to him: "I have done all these things; what more is there?"
Jesus then replied: "If you wish to be complete, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor. You will have wealth in heaven. Then follow me!"
But hearing these words, the young man went away grieving, for he was very wealthy.
Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven.
"Again I say, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God."
The disciples were greatly surprised when they heard this. "Who, then, may have salvation?" they asked.
Jesus looked at them and said: "With men this is not possible. All things are possible with God!"
Then Peter said: "See, we have given up everything to follow you. What then will we have?"
Jesus replied: "Truly I say to you, when all things are made new, and the Son of man is seated in his glory, you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
"Everyone who has given up houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or child, or land, for my name, will receive many times as much, and have everlasting life.
"Many who are first will be last. Some who are last will be first."
"The kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
"He made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day. Then he sent them into his vineyard.
"He went out the third hour and saw others in the marketplace doing nothing."
"He said to them: ‘ Go to the vineyard with the others. I will pay you whatever is right. ’ ’ So they went to work.
"He went out the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same.
"The eleventh hour, he saw others doing nothing. He asked: ‘ Why are you here all the day doing nothing? ’
"They said: ‘ No man has given us work. ’ ’ He told them to go work with the rest in the vineyard.
"When evening came, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager: ‘ Let the workers come and pay them from the last to the first. ’
"Those men who went to work at the eleventh hour were each given a penny.
"Those who worked longer, expected to be paid more. They were also given a penny.
"When they got it, they protested against the master of the house.
"They said: ‘ The last ones have done only one hour’s work. You have made them equal to us. We have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat. ’
"He told them: ‘ I do you no wrong. You made an agreement with me for a penny.
"‘ Take what is yours and leave. I wish to give to the last workers the same as to you.
"‘ Is it lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye jealous because I am generous? ’
"So the last will be first, and the first last."
When Jesus went to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and talked to them.
"When we get to Jerusalem," he said, "The Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They will give orders for him to be put to death.
"They will turn him over to the heathen to be made sport of and to be whipped. He will be put to death on the stake. The third day he will come back from the dead."
The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons. She bowed down and requested a favor of him.
"What is your desire?" he asked. She said to him: "Let my two sons be seated, the one at your right hand, and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus told her: "You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup I am about to take? »
They said: "We are able." "Truly, you will take of my cup," he said. "But to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus called them to himself and said: "You know that the rulers of the nations exercise absolute dominion over them. They lord it over them and behave like tyrants.
"But it will not be so among you. He who will be great among you must be your servant.
And he who will be first among you will be your attendant servant minister.
"The Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom in payment for many."
A great crowd followed him when they departed from Jericho.
Two blind men sitting by the side of the road heard Jesus pass by and cried out: "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
The crowd told them to be quiet. But they cried even more, saying: "Have mercy on us, O Lord, you Son of David!"
Jesus stood still and asked them: "What do you want me to do to you?"
They said: "Lord give us our sight."
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Now they could see! So they followed him.
They were near Jerusalem at Bethphage. Jesus sent two disciples to the Mount of Olives.
He told them, "Go to the nearby town and look for a donkey with a cord around her neck. There will be a young one with her. Turn them loose and bring them to me.
"Tell anyone who asks, ‘ The Lord needs them, ’ ’ and right away he will allow them to go."
This took place so that the words of the prophet might come true:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘ See, your King comes to you, humble, and seated on a donkey, a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden. ’"
So the disciples did as Jesus commanded.
They got the donkey and the young one, and laid their clothing on them. And he sat on the clothing.
Most of the people spread their garments on the road. Others took branches from the trees and put them on the road.
Those going ahead of him and following him shouted praise: "Glory to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah! Glory in the highest!"
When he came to Jerusalem, the people were excited. They asked: "Who is this?"
Other people said: "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
Jesus went into the Temple and drove out all who were trading there. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those trading in doves.
He told them: "It is written, ‘ My house is to be named a house of prayer, ’ ’ but you are making it a hiding place of thieves."
The blind and the crippled came to him in the Temple, and he made them well.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the powerful works he did. They heard the children crying out in the Temple: "Glory to the son of David." This made them very angry.
"Have you any idea what these people are saying?" Jesus answered: "Yes. It is written, ‘ From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete. ’"
He left them and went out of the town to Bethany where he stayed for the night.
He was hungry in the morning when he returned to the town.
He saw a fig tree along the side of the road. He went to it and saw nothing on it but leaves. He told it: "You will not bare fruit from this time forward, forever." Immediately the fig tree became dry and dead.
The disciples were surprised when they saw it. They asked how the fig tree became dry so quickly?
Jesus answered: "If you have faith and do not doubt, I make this promise to you: You will be able to do what was done to this fig tree. When you say to this mountain, be moved into the sea, it will be done.
"You will receive the things you ask for in prayer when you have faith."
When he went into the Temple, the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching. They asked: "By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered: "I will ask you one question. If you give me the answer, I will say by what authority I do these things.
"Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven or from men?" They talked among themselves. "If we say, ‘ From heaven, ’ ’ he will say, ‘ Why did you not have faith in him? ’
"But if we say, ‘ From men, ’ ’ we must fear the people, because they all recognize John to be a prophet."
Therefore they answered: "We have no idea." He replied to them: "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things."
"What do you think? A man had two sons. He asked the first to work today in the vineyard.
"The first son said in answer, ‘ I will not. ’ ’ Later he changed his mind and went to work.
"He said the same to the second son. That son answered, ‘ Yes, I will go, ’ ’ but he did not go to work.
"Which of the two pleased his father?" They replied: "The first." Jesus said to them: "I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will go into the kingdom of God before you."
"John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him. Even the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. When you saw this, you did not regret your sins and did not have faith in him.
"Listen to another illustration. A master of a house made a vineyard, and put a wall around it. He made a wine press and built a tower. Then he rented it to workers and traveled to another country.
"When the time for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the workmen, to get the fruit.
"The workmen attacked his servants, striking one with a stone and killing the other.
"He sent other servants more in number than the first. They did the same to them.
"Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘ Certainly they will respect my son. ’
"When the workmen saw the son, they said, ‘ Let us put him to death and take his heritage, for someday he will own this property. ’
"They took him out of the vineyard and killed him.
"When the lord of the vineyard returns, what will he do to the workmen?"
They all said: "He will put those cruel men to death. Then he will find other workmen who are worthy and who will give him fruit when it is ready."
Jesus said to them: "Have you read the Scriptures, ‘ The stone the builders rejected has been made the chief cornerstone of the building. This was Jehovah’s doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes. ’
"For this reason I tell you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you. It will be given to a nation producing fruit.
"Any man falling on this stone will be broken. Any man having this stone fall on him will be crushed to dust."
When the chief priests and Pharisees heard his illustrations they realized he was talking about them.
They wanted to seize him, but feared the people, because the people saw Jesus as a prophet.
Jesus continued to speak to them with illustrations.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.
"He sent out his servants to invite guests to the feast, but they would not come.
"Again he sent out other servants with orders to say to the guests, ‘ I have prepared my feast. Oxen and fat livestock are butchered and everything is ready, so come to the feast. ’
"But they paid no attention and went about their business. One went to his farm and another went to his trade.
"The rest violently attacked his servants and put them to death.
"The king was angry, and sent his armies to put the evil servants to death and to destroy their town with fire.
"He said to his servants, ‘ The feast is ready, but the guests were not worthy.
"‘ Go then, to the main roads, and invite all those whom you see to come to the feast. ’
"They went to the roads and brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike. And the banquet room was filled with guests.
"When the king met the guests he found that one of them was not wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding.
"The king asked why did he not wear proper clothes for the wedding? But the guest had no excuse.
"The king gave orders for that person to be tied hand and foot and thrown outside into the dark. That is where people will cry and grind their teeth in pain.
"Many are called, but few chosen."
The Pharisees took counsel how they might trap him in his talk.
They sent their disciples with the Herodians to Jesus. They said: "Teacher we know you are truthful. You teach the way of God in truth. And you are not partial to the influence of men.
"Tell us what you think? Is it lawful to pay the poll tax to Caesar, or not?"
Jesus perceived their wickedness. He said: "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
"Show me the tribute money." They brought a penny denarius to him.
He asked: "Whose image and superscription is on this coin?"
"Caesar’s," they said. Then he said: "Pay Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. Pay God the things that are God’s."
When they heard it, they were amazed and left him.
That same day, Sadducees came to him. They believe there is no resurrection. They asked him a question.
"Teacher, Moses said if a man dies having no children, his brother should marry his wife, and bring up seed for his brother.
"There were seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no children, left his wife to his brother.
"The same happened to the second, right on through the seventh.
"After that the woman died.
"In the resurrection, with which of the seven will she be married? All seven had her."
Jesus answered: "You are mistaken! You do not know the scriptures or the power of God.
"In the resurrection they will not marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you read that which was spoken to you by God?
"God said: ‘ I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. ’ ’ God is not the God of the dead, but of the living!"
When many people heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
The Pharisees assembled together when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence.
One of them, a lawyer, tested him by asking a question.
"Teacher what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus told him: "You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart Greek: kardia: feelings, emotions, and with all your being, and with your entire mind Greek: dianoia: understanding.
"This is the greatest and first commandment.
"The second like it is this: ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’
"The law and the prophets are based on these two commandments."
The Pharisees were gathered together, so Jesus asked them a question.
"What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said: "The son of David."
He said: "How then does David, directed by Spirit, call him Lord, saying,
"‘ Jehovah said to my Lord, "Sit on my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet." ’
"If David called him ‘ Lord, ’ ’ how is he his son?"
No one was able to answer him. After that they asked no more questions.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat," he said.
"Obey everything they teach you, but do not follow their example. They say one thing and do something else.
"They chain heavy burdens on your shoulders. Yet they are unwilling to lift even a finger to carry these same burdens.
"They do everything to be seen by men. For example: they enlarge their scripture cases for their foreheads and lengthen the tassels on their garments.
"They love the place of honor at banquets and the prominent seats in the synagogues.
"They require recognition in public places and insist on being called Rabbi by men.
"Do not be called Rabbi master teacher leader, for only one is your teacher. You are all brothers.
"Call no man your father on the earth, for only one is your Father in heaven.
"Do not be called master teacher leader, for only one is your master, and he is Christ.
"The greatest among you will be your servant.
"He who exalts himself will be humbled. He who humbles himself will be exalted.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You close the kingdom of heaven to people. You do not invite others to enter nor do you enter.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel on both sea and land to make one convert. When this happens, you make him twice as deserving of destruction in the trash fires of the valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna.
"Woe to you, you blind guides! You say, ‘ When you swear by the temple, it is nothing. ’ ’ Then you say, ‘ When you swear by the gold of the temple, you are obligated. ’
"You fools! You blind men! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?
"‘ When you swear by an altar, you owe nothing. When you swear by the gift left on the altar, you are obligated.
"You blind men! What is more important, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
"He who swears by the altar, swears by it and everything on it.
"He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him that dwells within it.
"Thus, he who swears by heaven also swears by the throne of God and him who sits on it.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy and faith. You should do both and leave nothing undone.
"You blind guides! You strain out the gnat and swallow the camel!
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, yet the inside is full of extortion and excess.
"You are blind. Clean the inside of the cup and platter first. Then clean the outside.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that appear beautiful on the outside. They are full of dead men’s bones and uncleanness on the inside.
"You appear righteous to men. However, inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs for the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous.
"You claim that you would not have been involved with your fathers when they spilled the blood of the prophets.
"You witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
"Fill up the guilt measure of your fathers.
"You serpents! You offspring of vipers! How will you escape from being destroyed in the ever-burning fires of the Valley of Hinnom? Greek: Gehenna, the trash fires in the valley just outside of Jerusalem
"Look! I am sending you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will torture and kill. Others you will torment and persecute from city to city.
"You are responsible for all the righteous blood shed on earth. That includes the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
"I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation those living at that time.
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the prophets and stone the messengers who are sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings. But you were not willing!
"Behold, your house is left desolate.
"I tell you, you will not see me until you say, ‘ Blessed is he that comes in the name of Jehovah. ’"
After Jesus left the temple, his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
He said to them: "Do you see these things? I tell you, not one stone will be left upon another. They will all be thrown down."
He sat on the Mount of Olives. The disciples came to him privately, saying: "Tell us when these things will be? What will be the sign of your presence and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered: "Be careful that no man misleads you.
"Many will come in my name, saying, ‘ I am the Christ, ’ ’ and will deceive many.
"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Do not be troubled, for this must happen, but the end is not yet.
"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
"These things are the beginning of birth pains Greek: odin': in the throws of pain, such as childbirth.
"People will cause you tribulation, and kill you. You will be hated by all the nations for my name’s sake.
"Many will stumble and betray and hate one another.
"Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
"Wickedness and lawlessness will increase. The love of many will grow cold.
"The person who endures to the end will be saved.
"The good news of the kingdom will be preached in the entire world for a witness to all the nations and then the end will come.
"When you see the disgusting abomination of desolation unclean thing spoken about through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place let him that reads understand,
"you in Judea flee to the mountains;
"you on the housetop do not go down to remove the things in your house.
"You in the field do not return to get your clothes.
"You who are pregnant or nursing babies in those days will feel trouble.
"Pray that your flight not be in the winter, neither on a Sabbath.
"There will be great tribulation. It will be greater than any has ever been from the beginning of the world until now.
"Unless those days are shortened, no flesh will be saved. For the sake of the chosen ones selected individuals, those days will be shortened.
"If someone says, ‘ Here is the Christ, ’ ’ or, ‘ Over there is the Christ, ’ ’ do not believe it.
"There will be false Christs and false prophets. They will show great signs and wonders so that many will be misled. This includes some of the chosen ones.
"Remember, I told you before it happens.
"If they say, ‘ Look, he is in the wilderness, ’ ’ or, ‘ He is in the inner chambers, ’ ’ do not believe it.
"Lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. The coming of the Son of man is like this.
"The eagles will gather at the place of the carcass.
"Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened. The moon will not give light. The stars will fall from heaven. The powers of the heavens will be shaken.
"The sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of earth will mourn. They will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
"He will send his angels with a great trumpet sound. They will gather together the anointed from the four winds, from one end of the sky horizon to the other.
"Learn from the illustration of the fig tree. When the branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.
"Therefore, when you see all these things, you will know he is near, even at the door.
"Truly I tell you, this generation those living at that time will not pass away till all these things take place.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
"No one knows the day and the hour the period of time. The angels of heaven do not know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows!
"The presence of the Son of man will be similar to the days of Noah.
"It will be like those days before the Flood. They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark.
"They were not aware until the Flood came and took them all away. The coming presence of the Son of man will be like this.
"Two will be in the field. One will be taken, and one will be left.
"Two will grind at the mill. One will be taken, and one will be left.
"Be alert, for you do not know what day the Lord will come.
"Know this, if the master of the house had known what time the thief was coming, he would have watched and his house would not have been vandalized.
"Be prepared! The Son of man will come at a time when you do not expect it.
"Who then is the faithful, thoughtful, and wise servant, whom his lord put in charge of his other servants, to give them their food at the proper time?
"That servant is blessed when his lord comes and finds him doing his will.
"I tell you, he will put him in charge of everything he owns.
"But if that evil servant says in his heart, ‘ My lord delays,
"so I will beat mistreat my fellow servants. ’ ’ And he eats and drinks with drunkards,
"the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect it, an hour when he is unaware.
"He will punish him severely, and send him to be with the hypocrites. There they will cry and grind their teeth.
"The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
"Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
"The foolish took no oil with their lamps.
"The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
"They all slept, because the bridegroom delayed his arrival.
"There was a shout at midnight. ‘ Here is the bridegroom! Come meet him. ’
"The virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.
"All the foolish virgins said to the wise: ‘ Give us your oil, for our lamps are going out. ’
"But the wise answered: ‘ There will not be enough for both of us. Go to the dealers and buy oil for yourself. ’
"While they were away, the bridegroom came. They that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut.
"Later the other virgins came, saying: ‘ Lord, Lord, open to us. ’
"But he told them: ‘ I do not know you. ’
"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.
"It is like a man going to another country. He called his servants and put them in charge of his property.
"To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one. He assigned according to the servants’ ability. Then he went on his journey.
"Right away the servant who received the five talents traded with them and made another five talents.
"In like manner, he who received the two gained another two.
"He who received the one dug a hole in the ground and hid his lord’s money.
"After a long time the lord of those servants came back to settle with them.
"The servant who received five talents brought another five talents. He said: ‘ Lord, here are your five talents, plus the five I gained. ’
"His lord said: ‘ Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, so I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your lord. ’
"The one who received two talents said: ‘ Lord you gave me two talents and I gained another two talents. ’
"His lord said: ‘ Well done, good and faithful servant. You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord. ’
"The servant who received one talent said: ‘ Lord, I knew you to be a hard man. You reap where you did not sow and gather where you did not scatter.
"‘ I was afraid, so I hid your talent in the earth. See, you have what is yours. ’
"But his lord answered: ‘ You wicked and lazy servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter.
"‘ You should have put my money in the bank. I should have received my money back plus interest.
"‘ Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
"‘ More will be given to every one who has and he will have abundance. He who does not have will have every thing taken away.
"‘ Throw the worthless servant into outer darkness. There will be crying and grinding of teeth. ’
"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
"All nations will be gathered before him. He will then separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
"He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
"The King will say to those on his right hand: ‘ Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
"‘ I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.
"‘ I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. ’
"The righteous will answer him: ‘ Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?
"‘ When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and dress you?
"‘ When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you? ’
"The King will answer: ‘ To the extent that you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me. ’
"Then he will tell those on his left: ‘ Depart from me, you cursed, into the ever-burning fire that is prepared for the Devil and his fallen angels.
"‘ I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
"‘ I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not dress me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me. ’
"They will also ask: ‘ Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison and not minister to you? ’
"The King will answer: ‘ To the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of my brothers, you did not do it to me. ’
"These will go away into ever-burning fire everlasting cutting off death total destruction doom punishment everlasting penalty, but the righteous to everlasting life. ’"
When Jesus had finished talking, he said to his disciples:
"As you know, the Passover will be here in two days. At that time the Son of man will be captured and impaled."
The chief priest and the elders of the people assembled at the court of Caiaphas, the high priest.
All of them, using deceit, worked together to capture Jesus and kill him.
They insisted: "Not during the feast; it could start a riot among the people."
Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.
A woman came to him having an alabaster vase containing very precious ointment. She poured it upon his head while he was eating.
The disciples saw it and were indignant. "To what purpose is this waste?
"This ointment could have been sold for much and the money given to the poor."
Jesus was aware of this and said: "Why do you trouble the woman? Her expression to me was good.
"The poor are always with you, but I am not always with you.
"She poured this ointment on my body to prepare me for burial.
"I tell you, Everywhere this good news is preached in the entire world, this good deed done by this woman will be spoken of in memory of her."
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests.
He asked them: "What are you willing to give me to deliver him to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
He continued to seek opportunity to turn him over to them.
The first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus. They asked: "Where do you wish to eat the Passover?"
Jesus told them to go into the city and tell a certain man: "The Teacher’s time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."
The disciples did as Jesus told them, to get ready for the Passover.
When evening arrived, he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.
While they ate, he said: "One of you will betray me."
They were filled with sorrow, and each one asked him: "Is it I, Lord?"
He answered: "He who dips his hand with me in the dish is the same one who will betray me.
"It is written that the Son of man will depart. The man who betrays him will experience much grief. It would have been better if that man had not been born."
Judas, the man who betrayed him, asked: "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus replied: "You said it."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed, and broke it; and he gave to the disciples. Then he said: "Take, eat; this is represents means exemplifies my body."
Then he took a cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: "Drink it all."
"This is represents means exemplifies my blood of the covenant, poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.
"I tell you, I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom."
After they sang a song of praise to God, they went to the Mount of Olives.
Jesus said to them: "All of you will fall away because of me tonight. It is written, ‘ I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ’
"When I am raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
Peter answered: "Even if everyone falls away because of you, I will never fall away."
Jesus said: "I say to you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter protested: "Even if I must die for you, I would not deny you!" His disciples said the same thing.
Jesus went with them to Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. He was sorrowful and very troubled.
He told them: "My heart is deeply grieved to the point of death. Stay with me and watch."
Then he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
When he came to the disciples, they were sleeping. He said to Peter: "Could you not watch with me one hour?
"Watch and pray continually that you do not enter into temptation!"
A second time he went away and prayed, saying: "Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be done."
He returned to find them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
He went away to pray a third time, saying the same words.
After returning to the disciples, he said: "Do you sleep now and take your rest? The hour is here and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
"Arise, let us go; the man who betrays me is here."
As he spoke, Judas, one of the twelve, followed by a crowd carrying swords and spears, approached him. The chief priest and elders of the people had sent them.
He that betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them: "The one I kiss is he. Take him."
He went directly to Jesus and said: "Hail, Rabbi," and kissed him.
Jesus told him: "Do that for which you came." They laid hands on Jesus, and captured him.
Look, one of them with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest.
Jesus told him: "Put your sword in its place. Those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
"Do you think I cannot ask my Father for help? He would send me more than twelve legions of angels.
"How then will the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?"
That very hour Jesus said to the people, "Have you come out to take me with swords and sticks as if I were a thief? You did not take me when I taught in the Temple daily.
"This has taken place so that the writings of the prophets will come true." Then all his disciples left him.
Those who captured Jesus took him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and those in authority also gathered there.
But Peter kept his distance. He followed him to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the servants, to see the outcome.
The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus. They wanted to put him to death.
They failed, even though a number of false witnesses came.
Later two witnesses came. They said: "This man said, ‘ I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to rebuild it in three days. ’"
The high priest stood up and said to him: "Have you no answer? What is it these say against you?"
Jesus said nothing. The high priest said to him: "I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus said to him: "You said it yourself. And I say to you, after this you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest ripped his robes apart and said: "He has said evil against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his words of blasphemy!"
"What is your opinion?" The crowd answered: "Put him to death!"
They spat in his face and hit him, saying:
"Prophesy to us, you Christ; tell us who hit you!"
Peter was seated in the square outside the house, and a servant-girl came to him. She said: "You were with Jesus the Galilean."
In front of everybody, he replied: "I do not know what you are talking about."
When he reached the gate, another saw him and said: "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
Again he denied with an oath: "I have no knowledge of the man."
A few moments later, those who were near approached and said to Peter: "Indeed, you are one of them, because the way you speak gives you away."
Then with curses and oaths he said: "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Peter remembered what Jesus told him: "Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.
It was morning. The chief priests and those in authority conspired to put Jesus to death.
They tied his hands with cords and led him to the ruler, Pilate.
Judas, his betrayer, heard he was to be put to death. Out of regret, he took the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and those in authority.
He said: "I have done wrong in giving a righteous man to you."
He left the silver in the Temple. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver. They said: "It is not right to put it in the Temple treasury, for it is the price of blood."
They decided to use the silver to buy the potter’s field. This would be a place to bury strangers.
This is the reason the field was named "Field of Blood."
Then Jeremiah’s prophecy was fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price he was valued by the children of Israel.
"Then they paid for the potter’s field, just as God directed."
Jesus stood before the governor. He asked him: "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him: "It is as you say."
When the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.
Pilate said to him: "Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you?"
Jesus did not answer. Not even a word! The governor was greatly surprised.
It was a custom for the governor to set one prisoner free at the time of the feast. The people were to help choose that prisoner.
At that time they held an important prisoner named Barabbas.
When they assembled, Pilate asked: "What is your choice? Barabbas or Jesus, the one called the Christ?"
He knew it was because of envy they gave him up.
While he was seated in judgment his wife sent a message to him. She said, "Do not judge that righteous man. I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him."
The chief priests and elders got the people to request Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.
The governor responded to them. He asked: "Which of the two do you want me to set free?" They shouted: "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them: "What am I to do with Jesus, the one called Christ?" They all said: "Put him to death. Impale him!"
"What evil has he done?" Pilate asked. But they shouted: "Impale him!"
Pilate saw that he could do nothing. The people were ready to cause much trouble. He took water and washed his hands in front of the people. He said: "The blood of this man is not on my hands. You are responsible."
The people answered: "Let his blood be on us, and on our children."
He set Barabbas free. He had Jesus whipped. Then he commanded that he be put to death on the stake.
Then the palace guard took Jesus into the open square and gathered their squad together.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a scarlet robe.
They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They placed a rod in his right hand. Then they bowed down on their knees before him. They mocked him, saying: "Long life to the King of the Jews."
They spat on him and hit him on the head with the rod.
After they mocked him, they took off the robe. He was dressed in his garments and he was led away to be impaled.
They then found Simon, a man from Cyrene. They forced him to go with them to carry the stake.
Golgotha, the Place of the Skull, was to be his final destination.
They gave him vinegar bitter wine to drink mixed with poison a drug gall. When he tasted it he would not drink.
When they impaled him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots.
Then they sat and watched him.
A sign was placed above his head with an accusation written: "This is Jesus the King of the Jews."
Two robbers were impaled with him. One was on the right hand and one on the left.
People passing by spoke evil abuse to him. They wagged their heads
and said, "You who would destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God come down from the stake."
In like manner the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked him.
They said: "He saved others, but cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the stake and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let him save him now if he wants him. After all he said: "I am the Son of God."
The robbers that were impaled with him also insulted him.
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" Which translated means: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
After hearing it some said this man calls Elijah.
Suddenly, one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
The rest said: "Let it be, and see whether Elijah comes to save him."
Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.
The veil curtain of the temple was ripped in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks split.
The tombs were split open and many dead bodies were tossed upright on the ground.
The centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake. Filled with much fear of the things that were done, they proclaimed: "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
The women who followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to him watched from a distance.
Included among the women were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
A disciple of Jesus named Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea,
went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, and departed.
Mary Magdalene was near the tomb. The other Mary was also there.
It was morning, the day after Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate.
They said: "Sir, we remember while he was yet alive, the deceiver said, ‘ After three days I will rise again. ’"
"Command the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise his disciples could come and steal him away. They could say to the people. ‘ He is risen from the dead. ’ ’ The last deception will be worse than the first."
Pilate said to them: "You have a guard; make it as secure as you can."
So they made the tomb secure. They sealed the stone and placed a guard there.
Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
Suddenly there was a great earthquake, as an angel of God descended from heaven and rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His appearance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
The guards shook with fear and became as dead men.
The angel spoke to the women: "I know you seek Jesus who has been impaled; do not fear.
"He is not here, for he has risen just as he promised. Come; see the place where the Lord lay.
"Go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead. See, he goes before you to Galilee. You will see him there, as I have told you."
They departed quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy. They ran to bring his disciples the news.
Jesus met them and greeted them. They approached and took hold of his feet and kissed them in adoration.
Then Jesus told them: "Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to travel to Galilee. I will see them there."
While they were going, some of the guard came into the city. They told the chief priests all the things that happened.
They took counsel with the elders. Then they bribed the soldiers.
The soldiers were instructed to say: "His disciples came at night and stole him while we slept."
"If the governor hears about this, we will persuade him so you may be free from worry."
So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.
The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain where Jesus specified.
When they saw him, they bowed down in adoration for him. But some doubted were lacking faith.
Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying: "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
"Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to observe all the things I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The prophet Isaiah wrote: "I am sending my messenger ahead of you to prepare your way."
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of Jehovah, make his paths straight."
John the Baptist was in the desert wilderness telling people to repent turn away from sin and be baptized for forgiveness of sins.
People from the province of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to hear John. They confessed their sins and he baptized them in the Jordan River.
John was clothed in camel’s hair with a leather belt about his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He told the people: "The man who comes after me is greater than I am. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his shoes.
"I baptized immersed you with water, but he will baptize Greek: baptizo: immerse, submerge you with Holy Spirit."
Soon Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.
When Jesus came out of the water he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descended on him like a dove.
Then a voice came from heaven:" You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."
At once the Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness filled with wild animals.
Satan tempted Jesus. This lasted forty days. The angels took care of Jesus.
After John was locked in prison Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News of God to the people.
Jesus said: "The time has come. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news."
Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two fishermen Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother. They were casting a net into the sea.
Jesus said: Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.
They immediately left the nets and went with him.
Jesus then saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing their nets to go fishing.
Jesus called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus.
Jesus and his followers traveled to Capernaum. On the day of worship Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
They were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught with authority and not like the scribes.
Suddenly in the synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit. He screamed:
"What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked the spirit by saying: "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man hard, gave a loud scream, and came out of him.
The people were all amazed and questioned. "What is this? What new doctrine is this? He has authority over the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
His fame spread to the entire country of Galilee.
Jesus and his disciples, including James and John, left the synagogue and went directly to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. At once they told Jesus about her.
He took her by the hand and helped her sit up. The fever suddenly left. So she got up and prepared a meal for them.
That evening at sunset many sick and demon-possessed people were presented to Jesus.
A huge crowd of people from all over Capernaum gathered outside to watch.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He cast out many demons. Knowing them he would not permit the demons to speak.
Early in the morning, long before daybreak, Jesus awoke and went into the wilderness to pray.
Later Simon and the others went out to find him.
They informed him: "Everyone is asking for you."
He replied: "We must go to other towns. I will preach to them too. I came for this purpose."
He went to Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.
A man with leprosy knelt in front of Jesus and begged to be healed. "If you want to, you can make me well," he said.
Moved with compassion Jesus touched him. "I want to," he said. "Be healed!"
Instantly the leprosy disappeared and man was healed.
Jesus sent him away and warned him. "Go directly to the priest and let him examine you.
"Do not talk to anyone along the way. Take the offering the Law of Moses requires for those healed of leprosy. That way everyone will have proof of your healing."
But the man gave a public account of his healing everywhere he went. Soon crowds surrounded Jesus and he could not enter a town publicly. He had to stay in secluded places and people continued to come to him.
Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum. The word spread that he was home.
So many people gathered that there was no room left even by the door. Jesus was speaking God’s word to them.
Men came to him carrying a paralyzed man.
They could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they removed the roof over the place where Jesus was. Then they lowered the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he told the man: "Friend your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scribes sitting there reasoned in their hearts:
"Why does this man speak this way? He blasphemes for only God is the one who can forgive sins."
Jesus immediately discerned in his spirit that they reasoned within themselves. He asked them: "Why reason these things in your hearts?
"Which is easier to say to the sick man your sins are forgiven or take your bed and walk?
"So you may see that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth," he said to the man:
"Get up and take your bed, and go to your house."
He got up, took the bed and went out before them all. They were all filled with wonder. They gave glory to God and said we have never seen anything like this.
Again he went to the seaside and all the people followed him. So he taught them.
He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, seated at the place where taxes were collected. He said to him: "Come with me." And he got up and went with him.
He was reclining at the meal in his house. Several tax collectors and sinners were at the table with Jesus and his disciples. There were a great number of them, and they came after him.
When the scribes of the Pharisees saw he was eating with the tax collectors and sinners they asked his disciples: "Why does he take food and drink with such men?"
Jesus heard this. He said to them: "Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill do. I have come to care for sinners not the upright."
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came to him and asked: "Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not?"
Jesus replied: "Will the friends of a newly married man practice fasting while he is with them? As long as they have him with them they will not go without food.
"But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.
"No man puts a patch of new cloth on an old coat. The new, by pulling away from the old, makes a worse hole.
"No man puts new wine into old wineskins. The skins will burst and the wine and the skins will be wasted. New wine has to be put into new wine skins."
Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath day. While they walked his disciples took the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said: "Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?"
He said: "Do you not know of what David did when he needed food for himself and his companions?
"He went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest. David took the holy bread for food and gave to his companions. Only the priests may take the holy bread.
"The Sabbath was made for man, said Jesus, and not man for the Sabbath.
"The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath."
He entered the Synagogue again. There was a man there whose hand was withered.
They watched to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath day. Then they might have something against him.
He said to the man: "Get up and come forward."
Then he asked the Pharisees, "Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? Is it right to give life or to put to death?" But they said nothing.
He looked at them and was angry. He was also sad on account of their hard hearts. He said to the man: "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out and his hand was healed.
The Pharisees went away and immediately conspired with the Herodians. They tried to decide how they might destroy him.
Jesus went with his disciples to the sea. A great crowed from Galilee followed. They were also from Judaea,
Jerusalem, Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and from Tyre and Sidon. These people heard the great things he did and came to him.
He asked his disciples to have a small boat ready because the crowd might press too close to him.
He healed many. Others with afflictions pressed close to him that they might touch him.
The unclean spirits fell down before him and cried: You are the Son of God.
He commanded them not to make him known.
He went up on the mountain and invited anyone who wanted to go with him.
He appointed twelve to be with him and he sent them out to preach.
He gave them authority to cast out demons.
The twelve included Simon whom he surnamed Peter,
James the son of Zebedee, John the brother of James surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananaean.
Also present was Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Then he went into a house.
The crowd gathered so close that they did not have time for bread.
When his own people heard of this they went to apprehend him. They said: "He has lost his senses."
Scribes that came down from Jerusalem said: "He has Beelzebub. He casts out demons by the prince of the demons."
Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in illustrations. He asked: "How could Satan cast out Satan?
"When a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand.
"When a house is divided against itself it will not be able to stand.
"If Satan has risen up against himself, he is divided, cannot stand and will come to an end.
"No one can enter into the house of the strong man and steal his property unless he first captures the strong man. Then he will steal his property.
"I tell you sins will be forgiven of the sons of men, and their evil talk will be forgiven.
"But whoever speaks evil and defames Holy Spirit will not be forgiven but is guilty of an eternal sin."
They exclaimed: "He has an unclean spirit!"
His mother and his brother were standing nearby. They sent for him.
A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him: "Look your mother and you brother are outside looking for you."
He answered them: "Who is my mother and who is my brother?"
Looking at the people who sat around him he said: "Behold, my mother and my brother!
"For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
Again he taught a very great crowd by the seaside. He sat in a boat while the crowd was on the land.
He taught them many things by illustrations and said to them:
"Listen, the sower went out to sow.
"As he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birds came and devoured it.
"Other seed fell on the rocky ground and did not have good soil. Immediately it sprang up, because it had no good soil
it became scorched when the sun came up. Then it withered because it had no root.
"Some seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it so it could yield no fruit.
"Others fell on good ground and yielded fruit. It grew up, increased and produced thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold."
He continued: "He who has ears to hear let him hear."
When he was alone his followers including the twelve asked about the illustrations.
He told them: "The secret of the kingdom of God is given to you. Illustrations are spoken to outsiders.
"So that seeing they may see and not perceive. And hearing they may hear and not understand. Otherwise they might repent and be forgiven."
Then he asked: "Do you not understand this illustration? How will you understand any of the illustrations?
"The sower sows the word.
"These are they by the wayside where the word is sown. When they have heard; Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them.
"The same is so of the word sown upon the rocky places. When they have heard the word and receive it with joy,
they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while. They stumble when tribulation or persecution arise.
"There is the word sown among the thorns. These have heard the word,
but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things enter in and choke the word. So it becomes unfruitful.
"Those who represent that sown upon the good soil hear the word and accept it. They bear fruit, thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold."
He asked them: "Is the lamp placed under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on the stand?
"There is nothing hidden unless it should be made known. Nothing is made secret that should come to light.
"If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
Then he said: "Be careful what you listen to. That which is portioned out by you might be portioned to you and more.
"He who has, to him it will be given. He who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has."
He added: "The kingdom of God is like this. A man plants seed in the earth.
"He sleeps and gets up night and day until the plants grow though he has no idea how.
"The earth gives fruit by itself. First comes the leaf, then the head, then full grain.
"When the grain is ready he immediately sends men to cut it, because the time for cutting has come."
He said: "What illustration should we use to picture the kingdom of God? What story will make it clear?
"It is like a grain of mustard seed. When it is planted in the earth it is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.
"But when it is planted it grows and becomes taller than all the plants. It grows out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade."
He spoke the word to them with many illustrations as long as they were able to listen.
He spoke only with illustrations. However he made all things clear to his disciples in private.
When evening arrived Jesus said: Let us go over to the other side."
They took him with them on the boat and left the people. Other boats were with him also.
A great windstorm came up and the waves came into the boat.
He was in back of the boat sleeping on a cushion. They woke him. They said: "Master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?"
He awoke from sleep and commanded the wind and sea. He commanded the sea to be at peace and rest. And he commanded the wind to go down and there was a great calm.
He said: "Why are you full of fear? Do you have no faith?"
Their fear was great. They said to themselves: "Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey his orders?"
They traveled to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.
Just as he got out of the boat a man with an unclean spirit came to him from the tombs.
He was living in the tombs. No man was able to bind him even with a chain.
Often he was bound in chains and iron bands but he would break them. No man was strong enough to keep him still.
Day and night in the tombs and in the mountains he cried out. He would cut himself with stones.
He saw Jesus from far off and quickly approached and bowed down before him.
Crying out with a loud voice, he said: "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the highest God? In God’s name do not torment me!"
Jesus commanded: "Come out of the man you unclean spirit!"
Then Jesus said: "What is your name?" He answered: "My name is Legion because there are a great number of us."
He earnestly implored him not to send the spirits away out of the country.
There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside.
They pleaded with Jesus: "Send us into the pigs!"
He let them do it. Then the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea. About two thousand of them died in the sea.
Their keepers ran off to the town to tell others what happened. People came to see what had taken place.
When they came to Jesus they saw the man who had been demon possessed. He was fully clothed and in full use of his senses. So they were afraid.
Those who saw the event gave a full account of what happened to the man, the evil spirits and the pigs.
They asked Jesus to leave their country.
Entering the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons asked that he might be allowed to travel with him.
Jesus told him: "Go to your house and to your friends and tell them about the great things God did for you and how he had mercy on you."
He went away and told others in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. They all marveled.
Again Jesus crossed over in the boat to the other side. A great crowd gathered to him while he was by the sea.
Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, saw Jesus and fell at his feet.
He pleaded with him saying: "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her that she will be healed and live."
Jesus went with him. A great crowd followed him and they pressed very close to him.
There was a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years.
She suffered treatment from many physicians but did not become better. She spent all her money and grew worse.
Hearing about Jesus she came though the crowd and touched his garment.
She said: "If I touch his garments I shall be made whole."
Immediately the flow of her blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
Suddenly Jesus recognized that power issued from him. He turned to the crowd and asked: "Who touched my garments?"
His disciples said to him: "You see all these people around you and you ask who touched me?"
He looked around to see the woman who had done this thing.
The woman was afraid and trembled. Knowing what happened she fell down before him, and told him the truth.
He said: "Daughter your faith has made you whole. Go in peace and be healed of your affliction."
While he yet spoke they came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house. They said: "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher."
But Jesus did not listen. He said to the ruler of the synagogue believe and do not fear.
He allowed only Peter, James, and John the brother of James to follow him.
The house of the ruler of the synagogue was filled with commotion. Many were weeping and wailing.
He entered and said: "Why all the commotion and why do you weep. The child is not dead but sleeps."
They laughed him to scorn. He sent them all out of the house. Then he took the father, mother and his companions and went to the child.
He took the child by the hand and said to her: "Talitha cumi." Which means when interpreted, "little girl I say to you arise."
Immediately the twelve-year old girl rose up and walked. And they were promptly amazed with a great amazement.
He gave them firm orders not to tell any man about this. Then he commanded that she be given something to eat.
He left there and went to his own country. His disciples followed him.
Jesus taught in the synagogue on the Sabbath. Many were astonished when they heard him. They asked: "Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to this man and how did he perform these mighty works by his hands?
"Is this the carpenter, the son of Mary, brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?" He offended them.
Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own people and in his own house."
He laid his hands upon a few sick and healed them. Otherwise he did no mighty work there.
He wondered at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages teaching.
He summoned the twelve and sent them forth in pairs. They were given authority over the unclean spirits.
They were instructed to take nothing for their journey, with the exception of a walking staff.
They were to take no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse and no extra sandals or coat.
He said: "When someone invites you to enter into a house, stay there until you leave.
"When someone will not listen to you leave that house and shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to the householder."
They went out to preach that men should repent.
They cast out many demons. They anointed the sick with oil and healed them.
John the Baptist had become well known. King Herod heard that John had risen from the dead. Therefore he was doing these powerful works.
But others said: "It is Elijah." And others said: "It is a prophet, like one of the prophets."
Herod said: "It is John whom I beheaded, raised from the dead."
For Herod captured John and locked him in prison for the sake of Herodias his wife. She was his brother Philip’s wife before he married her.
John said to Herod: "It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife."
Herodias had a grudge against John and was determined to have him killed.
But Herod feared John. He knew he was a righteous and holy man so he kept him safe. That is why he listened to John but was perplexed.
It was Herod’s birthday. He invited his lords, the military commanders, and the prominent men of Galilee to supper.
When the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests, she pleased him so much he promised her anything she desired.
He pledged to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half of my kingdom."
She asked her mother, "What should I ask?" And the mother said: "The head of John the Baptist."
At once she went to the king and asked: "Will you give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very sorry. Even so he kept his promise to her. He did not turn her down. This also showed his dinner guests he was a man of his word.
He immediately commanded his guard to behead John the Baptist and bring his head to him.
He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young lady. In turn she gave it to her mother.
When his disciples heard this they took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.
The apostles gathered together with Jesus. They told him all things they had done and taught.
He told them come into a secluded place and rest a while. For there were many people coming and going and they had no leisure time.
They went away in the boat to a secluded place.
The people from all the cities knew they were going and they ran together on foot to arrive ahead of them.
When he arrived and saw the great crowd he had compassion on them. They were as sheep without a shepherd. He taught them many things.
Late in the day his disciples approached him. They said: "The day is almost over and we are in a secluded place.
"Send them away that they may go to the country and villages nearby and buy themselves something to eat."
He replied: "You give them food to eat." They asked: "Should we buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread to feed them?"
He said" "Find out how many loaves you have? When they knew they said" "Five loaves and two fishes."
He commanded them to sit down by groups upon the green grass.
They sat down in groups of hundreds, and fifties.
Then he looked up to heaven and blessed the food. He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to his disciples. He also divided the two fishes. He gave the food to his disciples to serve to the people.
They all ate and were filled.
They collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fishes.
Five thousand men ate.
Jesus made his disciples hurry into a boat to cross to Bethsaida ahead of him. Then he sent the crowd away.
After he left he went to the mountain to pray.
He was on the shore at the beginning of evening and the boat was in the midst of the sea.
He saw that they were tired of rowing for the wind was against them. It was the fourth watch of the night. He walked on the sea and was about to pass them.
When they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a spirit an illusion and screamed.
They all saw him and were troubled. Suddenly he spoke to them: "Be of good cheer. It is I do not fear."
He entered the boat and the wind ceased. They were truly amazed.
They had not understood the loaves of bread. Their minds were closed.
They completed the crossing to the land of Gennesaret and anchored by the shore.
The people saw him as soon as they left the boat.
They were wherever he was in the whole region. They carried the sick on their beds to him.
When he entered a village or city in the marketplaces or the country the sick tried to touch the border of his garment and be healed.
The Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem to gather around Jesus.
They saw that some of his disciples ate their bread with unwashed defiled hands.
When they come from the marketplace they wash themselves before they eat. They follow many other rules. They wash their cups, and brass pots, and other vessels.
The Pharisees and the scribes asked: "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders. Instead they eat their bread with defiled hands?"
He told them: "Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites. It is written: ‘ This people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me.
‘ They worship me in vain teaching as doctrines the commands of men. ’"
Speaking to the Pharisees and scribes He said: "You abandon the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.
"You totally reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition.
"Moses said: ‘ Honor your father and your mother. He also said: ‘ He that speaks evil of father or mother must die. ’
"But you say: ‘ If a man says to his father or his mother that which would benefit you is a gift to God,
he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother. ’
"You make the word of God invalid by your tradition."
He called the crowd again and said: "Listen and understand!
"Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. That which comes from inside of a man can make him unclean.
"If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
When he entered the house away from the crowd his disciples asked him to explain.
He replied: "Do you not understand? Do you not know that which goes into the man from the outside cannot defile him?
"It is because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and is eliminated? All foods are clean.
"That which comes out of the man defiles the man.
"It is from the heart that evil thoughts come such as: fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
coveting, wickedness, deceit, loose conduct, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.
"All these evil things come from within and defile the man."
Jesus went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He did not want anyone to know that he was staying in a house there. However it could not be kept a secret.
A woman whose little daughter had an evil spirit heard about Jesus. She went to him and bowed down.
The woman was a Greek Syrophoenician by race. She wanted him to drive out the demon out of her daughter.
He said to her: "Let the children be fed first. It is not proper to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs."
She answered: "Yes Lord, even the dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs."
Then he replied: "Thanks to your answer you may leave for the demon has gone out of your daughter."
She went to her house and found the child on the bed with the demon gone.
He left the borders of Tyre through Sidon, through the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.
They brought a deaf man with an impediment in his speech to him and asked him to lay his hands on him.
Jesus took him aside from the crowd privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.
Looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him: "Ephphatha, that is, be opened."
His ears were opened. His tongue was freed and he spoke plainly.
Jesus told them not to tell anyone. The more he told them not to talk the more they talked.
They were beside themselves with amazement saying: He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak.
It was one of those days when there was a great crowd of people. They had nothing to eat so he called his disciples.
Jesus said: "I am concerned for these people because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
"If I send them away to their houses with no food they will be weak and faint. Some of them have a long way to go."
His disciples answered, "How could we get enough bread in this desolate place?"
Jesus responded: "How much bread do you have?" They said: "Seven loaves."
He made the people sit on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He gave the broken bread to his disciples and they served the people.
They had some small fish. After blessing them he had them serve the people in the same way.
After eating they picked up seven baskets full of food.
About four thousand ate. Then he sent them away.
Immediately he entered a boat and he and his disciples traveled to Dalmanutha.
The Pharisees came to question him. They were testing him and seeking a sign from heaven.
He sighed deeply in his spirit and said: "Why does this generation seek a sign? I tell you truly no sign will be given to this generation."
He left them and boarded the boat and departed to the other side.
They forgot to take bread and they only had one loaf with them in the boat.
He ordered them to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
They reasoned with one another saying: "We have no bread."
Hearing this Jesus said: "Why do you reason about having no bread? Do you not understand? Are your hearts dull of understanding?
"Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
"When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you up bring back?" They answered: "Twelve."
And the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you bring back? And they told him: "Seven."
He said: Do you not yet understand?
They arrived at Bethsaida. A blind man was brought to him with the request to touch him.
He held the blind man’s hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him. He asked him: "Do you see?"
He answered: "I see men. They look like trees walking."
He laid his hands on his eyes again and his vision was fully restored, he saw everything clearly.
He sent him to his home saying: "Do not enter into the village."
Jesus and his disciples went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples: "Who do men say I am?"
They told him: "John the Baptist and others say Elijah. Some say you are one of the prophets."
"Who do you say I am," Jesus asked. They told him: "You are the Christ."
He commanded them not to tell any man.
Then he taught them that the Son of man must suffer many things. The elders, chief priests, and the scribes will reject him. He will be killed and after three days he will rise from the dead.
Jesus spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and rebuked him.
He turned around and looked at his disciples. Then he rebuked Peter saying: "Get behind me Satan for you do not pay attention to the things of God. You tend to the things of men."
He then spoke to both his disciples and the crowd. He said: "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his stake and follow me.
"Whoever would save his life will lose it. Whoever would lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.
"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
"What should a man give in exchange for his life?
"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
He continued: "Truly I tell you there are some here who will in no way experience death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power."
Six days later Jesus took Peter, James and John up on a high mountain completely alone. He was transfigured in front of them.
His garments became brilliant white. Nothing on earth could make them this white.
Elijah and Moses appeared before them. They were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "Teacher it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
Peter and the others were afraid and they did not know what to say.
A cloud hovered over them and a voice came out of the cloud: "This is my Son the beloved listen to him!"
Suddenly they saw no one near them except Jesus.
They came down the mountain. He warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.
They kept questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead means.
Then they asked him how is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
He said: "Elijah does come first and restores all things. It is written that the Son of man should suffer and be treated with contempt?
"But I say to you that Elijah has come. They have done to him what ever they wished just as it is written about him."
When they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd with them and scribes questioning them.
Suddenly the crowd saw him and ran to him to greet him.
He asked them: "What are you talking about?"
One of the people answered him: "Teacher I brought my son who is unable to talk because of a spirit.
"The spirit seizes him and slams him down. He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. I asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do it."
Jesus then said: "O faithless generation. How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me."
They brought the boy to him. Suddenly the spirit threw him into convulsions. He fell on the ground rolled around and foamed at the mouth.
Jesus asked his father: "How long has this been going on?" He said: "Since he was a child."
Often it casts him into the fire and into the water to destroy him. If you can do anything have compassion on us and help us.
Jesus said to him: "All things are possible to him who has faith."
Both father and child immediately shouted: "I have faith make my faith stronger."
When Jesus saw the people he ordered the unclean spirit to come out of him. He commanded the spirit that caused the loss of voice and hearing to leave and never return to him.
The spirit cried out and shook the child violently. It came out and the child became like a dead person. Most of them said: "He is dead."
Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up.
When the child went into the house his disciples asked him privately: "Why were we unable to send it out?"
He replied: Only prayer will make this sort come out.
He desired that no man know about it. Therefore they left there through Galilee.
He taught his disciples: "The Son of man will be handed over to men who will put him to death. After three days he will come back from the dead."
They did not understand and they were afraid to ask him about it.
They traveled to Capernaum. When they were in the house he asked them: "What were you talking about on the way?"
They said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves about who was the greatest.
He sat down and the twelve came to him. He said: "If any man has the desire to be first, he would be last of all and servant of all."
He put a little child in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them:
"Whoever receives a little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me."
John spoke up: "Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he does not follow us."
But Jesus said: "Do not stop him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
"For whoever is not against us is on our side.
"Whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ’s, most assuredly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.
"If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better to enter into life maimed then, having two hands to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the Valley of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna
"If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life with only one foot, rather than having two feet to be cast into the ever-burning fires of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction
"If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom.
"For every one will be salted with fire.
"Salt is good. If it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again? Have the salt or seasoning of friendship among yourselves, and live in peace with one another."
Jesus crossed the Jordan River when he went to the province of Judea. Crowds gathered all around him just as they always did.
Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him. "Does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife?" They asked.
"What did Moses command you?" Jesus asked.
They said: "Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."
"He wrote this commandment because of your hard hearts," Jesus replied.
"God made male and female from the beginning of creation.
"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife.
"The two shall become one flesh. They are no longer two, but one flesh.
"That which God has joined together let not man take apart separate."
In the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.
He said: "He who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
"If she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.
People were bringing little children to him so he could touch them. His disciples turned them away.
But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation. He said: "Allow the little children to come to me! Do not turn them away for they belong to the kingdom of God.
"Truly I tell you, he who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall not enter it."
He took them in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them.
As he traveled someone ran to him, kneeled and asked him: "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life?"
Jesus asked him: "Why do you call me good? None is good except God.
"You know the commandments, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother."
"Teacher," he said: "I have observed all of these from my youth."
Jesus lovingly looked at him and said: "You lack one thing. Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
He was very sad when he heard this for he had many possessions. Then he went away.
Looking around Jesus said to his disciples: "It is hard for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus repeated it again: "Children, it is hard to enter into the kingdom of God!
"It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
They were greatly astonished! So they asked him: "Who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them: "With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God."
Peter said to him: "We have left all and followed you."
Jesus said: "Truly I tell you, a man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the sake of the good news,
will receive a hundred times as much now in this time, and in the age to come everlasting life.
"Many that are first will be last and the last first."
Jesus went to Jerusalem. The disciples followed him. They were amazed at what Jesus did. Others followed and were afraid. He met with the twelve to tell them the things that were to happen to him.
"When we go to Jerusalem the Son of man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the people of the nations.
"They will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him. Then they will kill him. After three days he will rise again."
James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him saying: "Teacher, we want you to do for us what we ask of you."
He asked: "What do you want me to do for you?
They said to him: "Allow us to sit next to you in your glory. One could sit on your right hand, and one on your left hand."
"You do not know what you ask," Jesus replied. "Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
They said: "We are able." Jesus replied: "The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized you will be baptized.
"But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give. It is for them for whom it has been prepared."
When the ten heard it they were indignant with James and John.
Jesus called them together and said: "You know that those who rule over the nations lord it over them. Their great ones exercise authority over them.
"It is not so among you. Whoever would become great among you, shall be your minister servant attendant.
"Whoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.
"For the Son of man also came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
They arrived at Jericho. He left there with his disciples and a large crowd. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the side of the road.
When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he cried: "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!"
Many rebuked him that he should keep quiet. However he cried out even more: "You son of David have mercy on me."
Jesus stood still and said: "You call him." They called the blind man saying to him, "Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you."
Setting aside his garment, he sprang up, and came to Jesus.
Jesus responded to him: "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him: "Teacher I want to receive my sight!"
Jesus told him: "Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way."
They came close to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. He appointed two of his disciples to
go into the village that is nearby. "As soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied there. No man has ever sat on that colt. Untie him and bring him.
"If any one questions why you do this say: ‘ The Lord has need of him. ’ ’ Immediately he will send it here."
They found a colt tied at the door in the open street and they untied it.
Those who stood there asked why are you untying the colt?
They told them what Jesus said and they let them go.
The colt was brought to Jesus. They laid their garments on him and Jesus sat on him.
Many spread their garments along the way. Others spread branches, which they cut from the fields.
Those who led the way and those who followed cried: "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in Jehovah’s name!
"Blessed is the coming kingdom, the kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!"
He entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. When evening came he went with the twelve to Bethany. ’
The next day they left Bethany. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree far off. When he got closer he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs.
He spoke about the tree that no man would ever eat fruit from it from that day forward.
When in Jerusalem he entered the temple and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the people who sold doves.
He would not allow any man to carry merchandise through the temple.
When he taught, he said: "Is it not written, my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers."
The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. They feared him because the crowd was astonished at his teaching.
And every evening he left the city.
They passed by in the morning and saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
Peter remembered and said: "Teacher look, the fig tree that you cursed is withered away."
Jesus answered: "Have faith in God.
"Truly I say faithful ones shall say to this mountain, be cast into the sea and it will happen. There must be no doubt in his heart and he must believe that what he says will come to pass.
"I tell you, believe that you receive what you pray for and you shall have it.
"When you say a prayer have forgiveness in your heart. Forgive anything you have against anyone so that your Heavenly Father will forgive you your sins."
Chief priests and scribes approached him at the Temple in Jerusalem.
They said to him: "By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you authority to do these things?"
Jesus said: "I will ask you one question. Give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things."
"The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men?" Give me an answer.
They thought about it among themselves saying: "If we say from heaven he will say why did you not have faith in him?"
They feared the people. "If we say from men the people would not like it because they all thought John was a true prophet."
They told Jesus" "We have no idea." Jesus said to them: "I should not say to you by what authority I do these things."
He taught them with illustrations: "A man had a vineyard planted. He built a wall around it. He prepared a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower. Then he rented it out to field workers, and went into another country.
"During the season he sent a servant to the field workers that he might receive the fruits of the vineyard.
"They beat him and sent him away empty.
"Again he sent another servant and they treated him shamefully and wounded him in the head.
"He sent another and they killed him. He sent many others and some were beaten and some were killed.
"Last of all he sent his son saying: ‘ They will respect my son. ’
"But those field workers said among themselves: This is the heir let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.
"They captured him and killed him. Then they cast his body out of the vineyard.
"What will the lord of the vineyard do? He will destroy the field workers and give the vineyard to others.
"Have you not read this Scripture: ‘ The stone the builders rejected was made the chief corner stone. ’
"This was from Jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes?"
They tried to capture him but feared the crowd. They perceived that he spoke the illustration against them. So they left him and went away.
Pharisees and Herodians went to him that they might catch him in talk.
"Teacher," they said, "we know that you are truthful, and not concerned about what other people think. You truthfully teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
"Should we pay or should we not pay?" Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them:" Why do you test me? Show me a denarius."
And they brought it. He said to them: "Whose is this image and superscription?" They said: "Caesar’s."
Jesus said: "Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s." They greatly marveled at him.
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection. They came to him to ask a question:
"Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.
"There were seven brothers the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
"The second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him. The third also died without leaving a seed.
"The seven left no seed. The woman also died.
"In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? For each of the seven had her as wife."
Jesus replied: "Is it not for this cause that you err? You do not know the scriptures or the power of God.
"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.
"It is a fact that the dead will be raised again. Have you not read the account of the burning bush in the book of Moses? Did you notice how God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
"He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly mistaken."
One of the other scribes came to him with a question: "What commandment is the first of all?"
Jesus answered: "The first is, Hear, O Israel; Jehovah our God is one God Jehovah.
"You should love Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your being with every breath you take your life, with your entire mind and with all your strength.
"The second is you should love your neighbor as yourself. No other commandment is greater than these."
The scribe said to him: "It is true teacher you ’ ve said it well that he is one and there is no one else besides him.
"To love him with all the heart, and with all understanding, and with total strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
When Jesus saw that he answered intelligently he said to him: "You are not far from the kingdom of God. No man dared ask any questions after that."
Still teaching in the temple Jesus said: "Do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
"Inspired by Holy Spirit David said: ‘ Jehovah said to my Lord sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. ’
"David called him Lord. How is it that he is his son?" The people were pleased with what he said.
He said: "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and to have greetings in the marketplaces.
"They demand the front seats in the synagogues and prominent places at feasts.
"They devour widows’ houses and for pretence make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation."
He sat down near the collection boxes and observed how the crowd dropped money into the boxes. Many that were rich dropped in much.
A poor widow came along and dropped in two mites.
He told his disciples: "Truly I tell you this poor widow gave more then all the others who gave to the collection box.
"They all gave out of their surplus. She gave out of her poverty. She gave all that she owned, all her living."
As he left the temple one of his disciples said to him: "Teacher look at these stones and the great buildings!"
Jesus said: "See these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another. They will all be thrown down."
He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple. Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately:
"Tell us when will these things be? What will be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?"
Jesus warned them: "Take heed that no man lead you astray.
"Many will come in my name Greek: onoma: claiming my authority, saying, I am he; and will lead many astray.
"When you hear of wars and rumors reports of wars do not be troubled. These things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
"Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines. These things are the beginning of pain sorrow trouble.
"Be on guard for they will deliver you up to courts. You will be beaten in the meeting places. You will be taken before governors and kings for a testimony to them for my sake.
"And the good news must first be preached to all the nations.
"When they deliver you up to judgment, do not worry before hand what you shall speak. Holy Spirit will give it to you at that time.
"Brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
"All men will hate you because of my name. He who endures to the end will be saved.
"When you see the unclean thing that makes desolation standing where he ought not let the reader use discernment, then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains.
"He who is on the housetop should not go down to enter and take anything out his house.
"He who is in the field should not return to take his clothes.
"Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
"Pray that this not be in the winter.
"The tribulation in these days will be greater then there has ever been from the beginning of God’s creation until now, and never shall be.
"Unless Jehovah shortened the days no flesh would be saved. For the sake of his chosen anointed he will shorten the days.
"If any man will say to you here is the Christ or there is the Christ do not believe it.
"There will arise false Christs and false prophets. They show signs and wonders that will mislead many, even the anointed.
"Be alert for I have told you all things beforehand.
"In those days after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light.
"The stars will fall from heaven and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
"They will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
"He will send the angels to gather together his anointed from the four winds, from one end of the earth to the other end of heaven.
"Learn the illustration of the fig tree. When her branch is tender and she sprouts leaves you know summer is near.
"So when you see these things happening you know that he is near, even at the doors.
"Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.
"Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away.
"No one knows the day or hour. The angels in heaven do not know. The Son of God does not know. Only the Father knows!
"Be awake beware be cautious and active, watch perceive and pray, for you do not know the time.
"It is similar to a man traveling to another country. He leaves his house and gives authority to his servants to do the work. He commands them to watch.
"Watch therefore for you do not know when the lord of the house comes. It could be in the evening, at midnight or in the morning when the cock crows.
"He could come suddenly and find you sleeping.
"What I say to you I say to all, be on the watch be vigilant stay awake be circumspect attentive and ready!"
It was just two days until the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might quietly capture and kill him.
They said: "Not during the feast for it might cause the people to riot."
He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. While he was dining a woman with an alabaster vase filled with costly perfume, of pure nard spikenard, brake it open and poured it over his head.
Some were very indignant over this. They asked, "What was the purpose of this waste of ointment?
"This ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii. And the money could have been given to the poor. They scolded her."
Jesus said: "Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She did a good thing to me.
"You always have the poor with you and you can do them good. You do not always have me.
"She did what she could! She anointed my body beforehand for burying.
"Truly I tell you everywhere the good news is preached through out the whole world, that which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her."
Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Jesus to them.
They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He looked for ways how he might conveniently deliver Jesus to them.
Now it was the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover. His disciples said to him: "Where do you want to go to prepare to eat the Passover?"
He sent two of his disciples into the city. He said: "Meet a man bearing a pitcher of water and follow him.
"Where he leads you say to the master of the house: The Teacher says where is my guest-chamber? Where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?
"He will show you a large upper room. It is furnished and ready. Prepare it for us."
The disciples went to the city and found everything as he described and they prepared for the Passover.
When it was evening he came with the twelve.
While they sat and ate Jesus said: "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, even he that eats with me."
They were sorrowful and said to him one by one: "Is it I?"
He said to them: "It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me in the dish.
"The Son of man goes even as it is written of him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better if he had not been born."
While they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said: "Take it, this means represents my body."
He took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it.
He said: "This means represents my blood of the covenant given for men.
"Truly I say to you, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God."
After a song of praise to God they went to the Mount of Olives.
Jesus told them: "You would all be turned away from me. It is written, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.
"After I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter declared to him: "Even though all shall leave you I will not."
Jesus said to Peter: "I tell you that before the rooster crows twice tonight, you will say three times that you do not know me."
Peter answered even more strongly: "I will never say that, even if I have to die with you!" All the other disciples said the same thing.
They came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: "Sit here while I pray."
He took Peter, James and John with him. He was very distressed and troubled.
He said to them: "I am very sorrowful to the point of death. Stay here with me and watch."
He went forward a little ways and fell on the ground to pray. He prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.
He said: "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take this cup from me. Even so not what I will, but what you will."
He returned to find them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Simon why do you sleep? Could you not watch for one hour?
"To avoid temptation watch and pray. The spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak."
Again he went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.
He came and found them asleep again. They did not know what to say to him.
He came a third time and said to them: "Sleep and take your rest. It is enough the hour has come. Look, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners!
"Rise up and let us go. He that betrays me is near."
Suddenly, as he spoke, Judas one of the twelve arrived. A great crowd with swords and spears were with him. They were from the chief priests, scribes and elders.
He who betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them the one I kiss is the one to capture and take away safely.
When he arrived he went straight to him and said: "Master" and kissed him.
They grabbed him and took him away.
One of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said: "Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me?
"I was with you every day in the Temple teaching and you did not take me. This is done so that the scriptures will be fulfilled."
They all left him, and fled.
A young man followed him. He was wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. They tried to grab him.
But they got a hold of the linen cloth and he fled naked.
They led Jesus away to the high priest. The chief priests, elders and scribes came together with him.
Peter followed him at a distance. He followed into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers staying warm by the fire.
Now the chief priests and the whole council looked for witness against Jesus to put him to death. They found none.
Many gave false witness against him. But their witness was not in agreement.
One person falsely witnessed against him by saying:
"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands."
Even so their witness did not agree.
The high priest stood in the middle of them, and said to Jesus: "Do you not answer? What is it these say against you?"
But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioned him: "Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?"
Jesus said: "I am and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
Violently parting his robes, the high priest said: "What need do we have for more witnesses?"
We have heard his words against God. What is your opinion? They all said he should be put to death.
Some spit on him and covering his face they gave him blows. Guess who hit you, they said. The leaders took him and beat him with their hands.
Peter was still in the courtyard when one of the High Priest’s servant women came by.
When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said: "You were with Jesus of Nazareth."
He denied it. "I do not know and I do not understand what you are talking about," he answered. He went out into the passageway.
The servant woman saw him there and told bystanders, "He is one of them!"
Peter denied it again. Later the bystanders accused Peter again saying: "You cannot deny that you are one of them, because you, too, are from Galilee."
Then Peter said: "I swear I am telling the truth! May God punish me if I lie! I do not know the man you are talking about!"
Then a rooster crowed. Peter remembered what Jesus said: "Before the rooster crows two times, you will deny me three times." He broke down and cried.
Early in the morning the chief priests met hurriedly with the elders, the teachers of the Law, and the entire Council. They made their plans. They led Jesus away in chains and handed him over to Pilate.
Pilate questioned him: "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered: "You say so."
The chief priests accused him of many things.
Pilate again asked him: "Do you not answer? See how many things they testify against you!"
But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate wondered.
He used to release one prisoner at the feast. This was done by request.
Barabbas, a rebel and a murderer was available for this purpose.
The crowd cried aloud and asked him to do as he always did for them.
Pilate answered them, saying: "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
For he knew that it was out of envy the chief priests delivered him up.
The chief priests influenced the crowd, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.
"What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?" Pilate asked.
They cried out: "Impale him!"
Pilate said: "Why, what evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, "Impale him!"
Wishing to please the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. Then he handed over Jesus. He was flogged and impaled.
The soldiers led him away to the court in the Praetorium building governor’s palace. They assembled together all of the troops.
They clothed him with purple. After weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him.
"Hail King of the Jews!" They shouted at him.
They struck his head with a reed and spat on him. They bowed their knees in false adoration to him.
After they mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to impale him.
Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus was passing by on the road. They compelled forced him to go with them, that he might carry his stake.
They brought him to the place called Golgotha. This means the place of a skull.
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.
After impaling him, they divided his garments among themselves, casting lots for them.
It was the third hour. They impaled him.
The superscription of his accusation was written on a board above his head, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
They impaled two robbers with him, one on his right hand, and one on his left.
The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."
Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
save yourself, and come down from the stake!"
Likewise, also the chief priests mocked among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He cannot save himself.
"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down from the stake that we may see and believe him." Those who were impaled with him also mocked him.
It was the sixth hour and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" Interpreted it means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of those who stood by said: "He is calling Elijah."
They filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. Then they said let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.
Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed his last breath of life.
The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
The centurion who stood nearby heard him cry out his last breath. Then he said: "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
The women watching from afar included: Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome,
who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him. Many other women came up with him to Jerusalem.
Evening arrived. It was the Preparation Day, the day before the Sabbath.
Joseph of Arimathaea was a prominent council member who also was looking for the Kingdom of God. He boldly approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.
Pilate wondered if he were already dead. So he summoned the centurion and asked him about the death.
When the centurion confirmed it he granted the body to Joseph.
He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth. Then he laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
After Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices so they could anoint him.
They went to the tomb when the sun had risen. It was very early.
They asked each other who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb?
The stone was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
They entered the tomb. They were amazed at what they saw. A young man dressed in a white robe was sitting on the right side of the tomb.
He said to them: "Do not be amazed. Jesus the Nazarene, who has been impaled, is not here. He has risen. Behold, the place where they laid him!
"Go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him just as he told you."
They fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone for they were afraid.
She told those who had been with him, for they mourned and wept.
When they heard that he was alive and she had seen him they did not believe it.
After this two of them saw him in another form as they walked, on their way into the country.
They went to tell the rest. They didn ’ t believe them, either.
Afterward he was revealed to the eleven as they sat at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
He said to them, "Go into the entire world, and preach the good news to the whole creation.
"He who believes and is baptized will be saved. He who does not believe will be condemned.
"These signs will accompany those who believe. They will cast out demons in my name. They will speak with new languages.
"They will pick up and handle serpents. Deadly drink will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."
After he had spoken to them the Lord Jesus, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
They went out and preached everywhere. The Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
Many have attempted to write an orderly narrative about the things that have taken place.
They received testimony from those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning. Ministers of God’s word delivered it to us.
Most excellent Theophilus Greek: Theo philos: friend of God: I have accurately traced the course of all things from the beginning. Now it seems good to me to write this report to you.
In this way you will know with certainty the truth that you were taught.
There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a priest named Zechariah. He was of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth.
They were both righteous before God. They blamelessly obeyed all the commandments and ordinances of God Greek: kurios: God.
They had no child for Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years.
He faithfully executed the priest’s duties before God.
The custom was to draw lots to see who served in the temple. It was his turn to enter into the temple of God and burn incense.
The whole crowd of people prayed outside at the hour of incense.
God’s angel appeared to him when he was standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
Zechariah was troubled. When he saw the angel he was filled with fear.
"Have no fear Zechariah," said the angel, "for God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elisabeth will have a son and his name will be John.
"You will be filled with joy, and many will be happy at his birth.
"He will be great in the eyes of God. He will not drink wine or strong drink and he will be full of Holy Spirit from the time of his birth.
"Great numbers of the children of Israel will return to Jehovah their God because of him.
"He will go before God in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness. This will make ready a people whose hearts have been directed to Jehovah."
Zechariah asked: "How might I be certain of this for my wife and I are old?"
The angel answered: "I am Gabriel, whose place is before God. I have been sent to give you this good news.
"You will be without voice or language till the day when these things happen. Your lack of faith in what I say has caused this."
The people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised he was in the Temple for such a long time.
When he came out he could not speak to them. They realized he saw a vision in the temple. Instead of talking he made signs to them.
When the days of his priestly service ended he went home.
His wife Elisabeth became pregnant. She remained in seclusion for five months.
She said: "This is the way God has dealt with me by taking away my reproach among men."
The next month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee
to a virgin named Mary. Mary was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of King David.
Gabriel appeared to her and said: "Greetings highly favored one. God is with you."
She was greatly troubled by this and wondered about the meaning of this salutation.
The angel said to Mary: "Do not fear for you have found favor with God.
"You will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son. You will call his name Jesus.
"He will be great. He will be called the Son of the Most High. Jehovah God will give him the throne of his father David.
"He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will not end."
Mary asked the angel: "How is this to be for I have had no intercourse with a man?"
The angel replied: "Holy Spirit would come to you and the power of the Most High will envelope you. Because of this the newborn will be called the Son of God."
"Your relative Elisabeth has also conceived a son even in her old age. This so-called barren woman is in her sixth month.
"When God speaks, these things are possible."
Mary said: "Look, Jehovah’s servant. Let it happen to me as you spoke." The angel departed from her.
Mary traveled with haste to the city of Judah in the hill country.
She entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elisabeth.
When Elisabeth heard the greeting from Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. Elisabeth was filled with Holy Spirit.
She shouted loudly: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
"How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
"When I heard your greeting the baby leaped in my womb for joy.
"Blessed is she that believes. That which God spoke will be fulfilled."
Mary said: "My life magnifies Jehovah my God.
"My heart and mind rejoice in God my Savior.
"He has looked on the low position of his servant. All generations from now on will call me blessed.
"He that is mighty has done great things to me. Holy is his name.
"His mercy is to all generations for all who respect him.
"He shows strength with his arm. He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their heart.
"He removes rulers from their thrones and exalts the humble.
"He fills the hungry with good things and sends the rich away empty handed.
"He has helped Israel his servant that he might remember mercy.
"He spoke to our fathers. To Abraham and his seed forever."
Mary stayed with Elisabeth about three months, and returned to her house.
Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth. She gave birth to a son.
Her neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.
On the eighth day they circumcised the child. They planned to call him Zechariah, after the name of the father.
His mother spoke up and said: "He shall be called John."
They all said: "None of your relatives are called by this name."
They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John." They were all amazed.
Immediately his tongue loosed, his mouth opened and he spoke, blessing God.
Everyone nearby was in fear. These accounts spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.
All that heard them wondered in their heart, saying, "What will this child be? For the hand of Jehovah was with him."
His father Zechariah was filled with Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
"Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel. He has visited his people and brought them redemption.
"He raised up a horn of salvation power of deliverance for us in the house of his servant David
"He spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ages past.
"He provided salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.
"He shows mercy towards our fathers and remembers his holy covenant.
"It was the oath he spoke to Abraham our father.
"He gave us deliverance out of the hand of our enemies so we could serve him without fear.
"May we serve in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
"Your child will be called the prophet of the Most High. You will go in advance of Jehovah God to make his ways ready.
"To give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins.
"A rising of light will visit us from on high because of the tender mercy of our God.
"The light will shine on them who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. It will guide our feet into the way of peace."
The child grew and became spiritually strong. He lived in the deserts till the time came to show himself to Israel.
In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the inhabited earth.
This was the first census made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
So every one went to his hometown to register.
Joseph came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to be counted and taxed. He went to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.
He registered himself with Mary, who was engaged to him. She was about to become a mother.
While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth.
She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger. That was because there was no room for them in the inn.
Shepherds in the same country were in the field keeping watch by night over their flock.
God’s angel stood by them and His glory gave illumination around them and they were very afraid.
The angel spoke to them: "Do not be afraid. Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy to all the people.
"Christ Messiah the Lord, a Savior, is born this day in the city of David.
"This is the sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger."
Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God, and saying:
"Glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth among men with whom he is pleased."
The angels went away from them into heaven. Then the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which God told us about."
They hurried to see the baby. They found Mary and Joseph. And they saw the baby lying in the manger.
As soon as they saw it they told what they had heard about the child.
All that heard it wondered at the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.
Mary remembered all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen.
After eight days the baby was circumcised. He was called by the name, Jesus. Jesus: Jehovah is salvation This was the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
Following the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem. There they would present him to Jehovah.
It is written in God’s law that every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to Jehovah.
According to God’s Law they must offer a sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for God to save Israel. God’s Holy Spirit was working in him.
Holy Spirit revealed to him that he would not die before he saw the Christ of Jehovah.
Under the power of the spirit he came to the temple. The parents brought in the child Jesus, that they obey the custom of the law.
He received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:
"Let your servant depart according to your word in peace.
"My eyes have seen your salvation.
"That which you prepared before the peoples.
"It is a light of revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel."
Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning him.
Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother: "This child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against.
"A sword will pierce through your mind that the thoughts of many hearts will be disclosed."
Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher was a very old prophetess.
She had been a widow eighty-four years. She never left the temple. She worshipped and fasted with supplications day and night.
Even up to that time she gave thanks to God and spoke to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of God they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
The child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom and was blessed by God.
Every year his parents went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.
When he was twelve years old they went to the feast of the Passover, as was their custom.
When the feast ended they started the return trip. Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know this.
They thought he was in the traveling company. After a day’s journey they looked for him among their relatives and friends.
When they could not find him they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.
After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers. He was listening and asking them questions.
All that heard him were amazed at his understanding.
When they saw him they were astonished. His mother said to him: "Son, why did you treat us this way? Your father and I have searched for you and we have been worried."
He said: "Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?"
They did not understand what he said to them.
He went with them to Nazareth. He remained subject to them. His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
It was the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea. Herod served as tetrarch of Galilee. Herod’s brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis. Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene.
This was in the time when Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests. The word of God was delivered to John the son of Zechariah. He was in the wilderness.
John traveled in the region near the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
This was according to the words of Isaiah the prophet: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make ready the way of Jehovah. Make his paths straight.
"Every valley shall be filled. Every mountain and hill shall be brought low. The crooked shall become straight and the rough ways smooth.
"All flesh shall see the salvation of God."
He told the crowds that came to be baptized by him: "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
"Produce fruit that is worthy of repentance. Do not say we have Abraham for our father. I tell you, that God is able to make these stones into children for Abraham.
"The axe is now at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown in to the fire."
The people asked him: "What must we do?"
He answered: "He who has two coats let him give to him who has none. He who has food let him do likewise."
Tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him: "Teacher, what must we do?"
He told them: "Collect no more than that which is prescribed."
Soldiers also asked him: "What must we do?" And he said: "Do not take money from any one by force. Never falsely accuse any one wrongfully and be content with your wages."
Many people were expecting the Messiah. They reasoned in their hearts concerning John: "Perhaps he was the Messiah."
John answered, saying to them: "I baptize you with water. He is coming who is mightier than I. I am not worthy to untie his shoelaces. He will baptize you in Holy Spirit and in fire.
"His winnowing fork is in his hand ready to thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor. He will gather the wheat into his barn. He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
He preached good news to the people by offering many encouraging words.
John reproved Herod the tetrarch for all the evil things he had done for he took his brother Herodias’ wife.
He added this also to them all. He locked up John in prison.
When all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. He prayed and heaven was opened.
Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily form like a dove. A voice came out of heaven. He said: "You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."
When Jesus began to teach he was about thirty years old. Jesus was the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,

the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the Son of God.
Jesus was full of God’s Holy Spirit when he returned from the Jordan. Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness.
He spent forty days in the wilderness being tempted by the devil. He did not eat anything during those days so when it was over he was hungry.
The devil said to him: "If you are the Son of God command this stone to become bread."
Jesus answered him: "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone."
He led him up to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Then the devil said: "I will give all this authority and glory to you, for it has been turned over to me. I may give it to whomever I will.
"If you will worship me it will all be yours."
Jesus answered: "It is written, you shall worship Jehovah your God and him only shall you serve."
He led him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle highest level of the temple. Then he said to him: "If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here.
"It is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning you to guard you.
"They will carry you with their hands so you do not dash your foot against a stone."
Jesus replied: "It is said you should not test Jehovah your God."
When the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him for a season.
Jesus was directed by God’s Spirit to return to Galilee. His reputation spread through out the region.
He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.
Then he returned to Nazareth the place where he was raised. He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day. This was his custom. There he stood up to read.
He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it was written:
"The Spirit of Jehovah is upon me. He anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind. To set at liberty those who are bruised.
"To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah."
He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.
"Today," he said, "you heard this scripture fulfilled."
All witnessed this and wondered at the kind words that he spoke. They said: "Is this not Joseph’s son?"
Then he said: "You will no doubt say this proverb to me, physician heal yourself. That which we heard was done at Capernaum do also here in your own country."
He continued: "Truly I tell you no prophet is accepted welcomed honored in his own country.
"I tell you truth. There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. There was no rain from heaven three years and six months. There came a great famine over all the land.
"Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was only sent to Zarephath in the land of Sidon. She was a widow.
"There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Only one of them was cleansed, Naaman the Syrian."
Everyone in the synagogue was angry when they heard these things.
They rose up to drive him out of the city. They led him to the top of the hill where their city was built to throw him down the hill.
But he passed through the midst of them and went his way.
Next he traveled to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he taught them on the Sabbath day.
They were astonished at his teaching for he spoke with authority.
A man in the synagogue had a spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out with a loud voice:
"What have we to do with you Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him, saying: "Be quiet and come out of him." When the demon had thrown him down in front of them, he came out of him without harming him.
All were amazed and spoke to one another. "What is he telling us? For he speaks with authority and with power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out."
A rumor concerning him spread to every place of the region.
He left the synagogue and went to Simon’s house. Simon’s mother in law was suffering with a great fever. They asked him to help her.
He stood over her and rebuked the fever. It left her and immediately she rose up and ministered to them.
When the sun was setting they brought many who were sick of different diseases to him. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
Demons came out from many. They cried out: "You are the Son of God!" He rebuked them and charged them not to speak for they knew he was the Christ.
The next day he went to a secluded place. The crowds followed him. They did not want him to leave them.
He said to them: "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also. This is why I was sent."
He preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
Jesus stood by the Lake of Gennesaret as the crowds pressed in upon him in order to hear the word of God.
He saw two boats docked by the shore. The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets.
He boarded one of the boats. It was Simon’s boat. He asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.
When he finished speaking he asked Simon to put into deep water and let down the nets for a catch.
Simon answered, Master we worked all night and caught nothing. At your word I will let down the nets.
When they did this they caught a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.
They called their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They filled both boats until they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus’ knees. He said: "Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
He and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish.
So were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon: "Do not fear. From now on you will catch men."
After they brought their boats to land they left all and followed him.
One time while he was in one of the cities a man full of leprosy fell on his face before Jesus. He said: "Lord, if you want to you can make me clean."
He stretched forth his hand and touched him, saying: "I want to, be made clean." Immediately the leprosy departed from him.
He told him to tell no one and go and show himself to the priest. Then he was to make a cleansing offering, just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
The news about him spread far away and large crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.
He withdrew to a quiet place and prayed.
One day when he was teaching, Pharisees and doctors of the Law were in the crowd. People came from every village of Galilee, Judea and Jerusalem. God’s power was with him to heal.
Men brought a man on a bed. He was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.
They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd. So they went up to the housetop and let the man and the bed down through the tiles to Jesus.
Seeing their faith, Jesus said: "Man your sins are forgiven you."
The scribes and the Pharisees reasoned saying: "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
Jesus perceived their reasoning and said to them: "Why do you reason in your hearts?
"Which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or arise and walk?
"So you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins," he said to the man who was paralyzed, "I say to you, arise, take up your bed and go to your house."
Immediately he rose up before them, took his bed and departed to his house, glorifying God.
Everyone was amazed and they glorified God. They were filled with fear. They said: "We have seen strange things today."
After that he met a tax collector named Levi sitting at his place of business. He told him: "Follow me."
He gave up everything and followed him.
Levi made him a great feast in his house. There was a large group of tax collectors and of others that were sitting at the meal with them.
And the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus disciples. They asked: "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus answered them: "Those who have good health do not need a physician. The sick do.
"I did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."
They said: "The disciples of John fast often and make supplications. So do the disciples of the Pharisees. But yours eat and drink."
Jesus replied: "Could you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
"The days will come and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast."
He told an illustration to them: "No one takes a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise he will tear the new. Also the new will not match the old.
"No one puts new wine in old wine skins. The new wine will burst the old skins and spill the wine.
"But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins.
"After drinking old wine no one desires the new for the old is better."
Jesus and his disciples went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples plucked the ears, rubbed them in their hands and ate.
Some of the Pharisees asked: "Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"
Jesus answered: "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry. He and his companions,
entered into the house of God. They and the others with them ate the showbread holy bread. It is only lawful for the priest to eat it."
He continued: "The Son of man is lord of the Sabbath."
He entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath and taught. There was a man there whose right hand was withered.
The scribes and the Pharisees watched to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. They looked for a way to accuse him.
He knew their thoughts. So he said to the man that had the withered hand: "Stand up and come here." He arose and stepped forward.
Jesus said: "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm? Is it lawful to save a life, or to destroy it?"
He looked around at everyone and said to the man: "Stretch out your hand." And he did so and his hand was restored.
They were all very angry and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
He went to the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God.
The next day he called his disciples to choose from them twelve, whom he named apostles ambassadors messengers:
Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealous one,
And finally there was Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
He came down with them, and stood on a level place. A great crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem came to hear him. Others from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.
Those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.
The crowd tried to touch him for power came forth from him and healed them all.
He looked at his disciples and said: "Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God.
"Blessed are you who hunger now for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now: for you shall laugh.
"Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For your reward is great in heaven. Your fathers treated the prophets the same way.
"Woe to you who are rich! You have received your reward.
"Woe to you who are full now! For you will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! You will mourn and weep.
"Woe to you when all men speak well of you! Their fathers did the same to the prophets.
"I tell you who listen, love your enemies and do good to those who hate you.
"Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who despitefully use you.
"When someone slaps you on one cheek offer the other. Give your coat to the one who takes your topcoat.
"Give to every one who asks of you and do not demand back your goods from he who takes from you.
"As you would like men to do to you, do also to them.
"If you love those who love you what thanks do you have? Even sinners love those who love them.
"If you do good to those who do good to you what thanks do you have? Even sinners do the same.
"If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive what thanks do you have? Even sinners lend to sinners to receive again as much.
"Love your enemies and do good to them. Lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great. You will be sons of the Most High for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
"Be merciful even as your Father is merciful.
"Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.
"Give and it shall be given to you. You will receive a good measure. It will be pressed down, shaken together, running over and they will give it to you. For with the measure that you measure out it will be measured to you also."
He told them an illustration: "Can the blind guide the blind? Would they both fall into a pit?
"The disciple is not above his teacher. Every one will be like his teacher when he is fully trained.
"Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye? Yet you do not consider the beam in your own eye.
"How can you say to your brother: ‘ Let me remove the speck in your eye when you do not notice the beam in your own eye? ’ ’ You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
"A good tree does not produce corrupt fruit and a corrupt tree does not produce good fruit.
"The identity of a tree is made clear by the fruit it produces. Men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble.
"The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good. The evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth that which is evil. Out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
"Why do you call me Lord, and do not do what I tell you to do?
"Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.
"He is like a man building a house. He dug and laid a deep foundation upon the rock. A flood sent a stream of water against the house and could not shake it because it was well built.
"He who hears but does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation. A flood will send a stream of water and immediately it will fall. The ruin of that house will be great."
After he taught the people he went to Capernaum.
A centurion’s servant, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and at the point of death.
When he heard about him he contacted Jesus through the Jewish elders. He asked him to come and save his servant.
They came to Jesus and earnestly pleaded with him saying: "He is worthy and you should do this for him.
"He loves our nation and he also built our synagogue for us."
Jesus went with them. As he approached the house, the centurion sent friends to him saying, "Lord do not trouble yourself. I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.
"I am also not worthy to come to you. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
"I also am a man with much authority. I am in charge of soldiers and say to this one go and he goes and to another I say come and he comes. I tell my servant to do this and he does it."
Jesus heard this and marveled at him. He turned to the crowd and said, "I tell you I find no greater faith in Israel."
When the messengers returned to the house they found the servant in good health.
After that he, his disciples and a great crowd went to a city called Nain.
When he came near the gate of the city he saw people carrying a dead person. It was the only son of a widow. Many people were with her.
When the Lord saw her he had sympathy for her. "Do not cry," he said.
He came near the casket and touched it. The bearers stood still. He said, "Young man arise."
He who was dead sat up and spoke and he was returned to his mother.
They were all afraid and they praised God. They said: "A great prophet has appeared among us. God has visited inspected selected his people."
News about him went through out all Judea and around the region.
The disciples of John told him the news.
John sent two of his disciples to the Lord. They asked, "Should we look for another or are you the one?"
When the men found him they said: "John the Baptist sent us. Are you the one who comes or should we look for another?"
In that hour he cured many diseases, plagues and evil spirits. Sight was restored to the blind.
He answered John’s disciples: "Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard. The blind receive their sight! The lame walk and lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear! The dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them.
"Blessed is he who is not offended by me."
After John’s disciples departed he told the crowd about John: "What did you go into the wilderness to find? Was it a reed shaken with the wind?
"What did you go to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Only kings dress in fancy clothes.
"What did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes I tell you and much more than a prophet.
"This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send my messenger before you. He will prepare a way before you.
"I say to you, of those who are born of women there is none greater than John. Yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
When the people heard, they acknowledged God’s justice. They received their baptism from John.
The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God and were not baptized by him.
"To whom or what should I compare the men of this generation?
They are like children that sit in the marketplace and call to each other. We played the flute for you but you did not dance. We wailed and you did not weep.
"John the Baptist came fasting and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon.
"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and you say look he is a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!
"All her children vindicate wisdom."
One of the Pharisees asked him to dine with him. He went to the Pharisee’s house and sat down to eat.
A sinful woman went to the Pharisee’s house. She brought an alabaster vase filled with ointment.
Standing by his feet weeping, she wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with the hair of her head. Then she kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
The Pharisee saw it and thought to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman touched him. She is a sinner.
Jesus said to Simon: "I have something to tell you." He replied: "What teacher?"
"A certain lender had two debtors. One owed five hundred shillings and the other fifty.
"They did not have money to pay the debt so he forgave them both. Which of them did he love the most?"
Simon answered: "I suppose it was the one whom he forgave the most." Jesus said: "Your judgment is correct."
Turning to the woman, he said to Simon: "See this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet. She watered my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
"You did not kiss me. Since the time I came in she has not ceased kissing my feet.
"You did not anoint my head with oil. She anointed my feet with ointment.
"She loved much! She has many sins and they are forgiven. When little is forgiven, little love is shown."
He said to her: "Your sins are forgiven!"
Those who ate with him said within themselves: "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
He said to the woman: "You are saved because of your faith. Go in peace."
Jesus and the twelve apostles traveled through cities and villages preaching the good news of the kingdom of God.
Traveling with him were the women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities. This included Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.
Also healed was Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna. There were many others, who supported them out of their private substance.
A great crowd came to him from every city. He spoke to them with an illustration:
"The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed some fell by the side of the road. It was trampled under foot and the birds of heaven devoured it.
"Other seed fell on the rock. As soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture.
"Still other seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew with it, and choked it.
"Other seed fell on the good ground. It grew and produced fruit a hundredfold." As he said these things he cried. He said: "He who has ears to hear let him hear."
His disciples asked him what this illustration means.
He said: "You are meant to know the secrets of the kingdom of God. I speak to the rest in illustrations, that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand.
"Now the illustration is this: The seed is the word of God.
"Those by the side of the road are they who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.
"Those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy. These have no root. They believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.
"The seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word and go their own way. They are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not produce fruit.
"The good ground represents the honest and good-hearted people. They hear the word, hold fast to it and produce forth fruit with patience."
"No one lights a lamp and puts a cover over it or hides it under a bed. Instead he places it on a stand that everyone entering may see the light.
"Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. Nothing is secret that will not be made known and come to light.
"Pay attention and hear! Whoever has will be given more. Whoever does not have, more will be taken away, and even what he thinks he has will be taken."
His mother and brother tried to come to him but could not because of the crowd.
They told him: "Your mother and your brothers are near. They wish to see you."
He answered, "My mother and my brother are these who hear the word of God, and do it."
He said to his disciples: "Let us go to the other side of the lake." Then he and his disciples boarded a boat and did so.
Jesus fell asleep as they sailed to the other side. A large windstorm came to the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.
They awoke him saying: "Master, Master, we parish!" He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and there was calm.
He asked them, "Were is your faith?" They were afraid and they marveled. They asked: "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
They arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is near Galilee.
When he arrived on the shore, a demon-possessed man met him. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house but in the tombs. He had been this way a long time.
When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down in front of him. He shouted in a loud voice: "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I implore you do not torment me."
The spirit seized him many times. For this reason he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts. Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man!
Jesus asked him: "What is your name?" He answered: "Legion" for many demons had entered into him.
They pleaded with him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.
There was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. They entreated him that he would allow them to enter into them. He gave them permission.
The demons came out from the man and entered into the swine. The herd rushed down the hill into the lake, and was drowned.
The herdsmen saw what happened and rushed to the city to tell others.
They went out to see what happened. They came to Jesus and found the man who had been demon possessed. He was clothed, in his right mind and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were afraid.
They then learned how he was possessed with demons and became whole.
The people of the country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart. They were very much afraid. So he boarded a boat and left.
The man who once had demons asked him if he could go with him. Jesus sent him away saying:
"Return to your house and declare the great things God has done for you." He went throughout the whole city telling the great things Jesus had done for him.
When Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him. They were all waiting for him.
Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue came to Jesus. He fell down at Jesus’ feet and implored him to come to his house.
His twelve-year old daughter was dying. She was his only daughter. As he went the crowds surrounded him.
There was a woman having an issue of blood twelve years. She spent all her money on physicians, and could not be healed by any.
She came behind him and touched the border of his garment. Immediately the issue of blood stopped.
Jesus said: "Who touched me?" Peter and the others with him said: "Master, the people press in from all sides."
Jesus said: "Someone did touch me. I perceived that power went from me."
When the woman knew she was discovered she trembled, fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the people why she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
He said to her: "Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace."
While he yet spoke someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house saying: "Your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher."
When Jesus heard this he said: "Do not fear, only believe and she will be made whole."
When he arrived at the house he allowed only the mother and father of the girl, Peter, John and James to enter with him.
They were all weeping and morning her. He said: "Do not weep for she is not dead, but sleeps."
They laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead.
He took her hand and called: "Maiden, arise."
Her life force returned and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given her to eat.
Her parents were amazed. He charged them to tell no man what had been done.
He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
He said, "Take nothing for your journey. Do not take a staff or food or money. Do not even take two coats.
"Stay at the house you enter until you depart.
"If someone does not receive you, when you leave the city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against that person."
They departed and went throughout the villages preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.
Herod the ruler of Galilee heard of all that was done and was very perplexed confused skeptical. Some said John the Baptist was raised from the dead and that he did it.
Others said that Elijah had appeared and others and that one of the old prophets had risen again.
Herod said: "I beheaded John, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" He wanted to see him.
When the apostles returned they told Jesus about the things they had done. They traveled to the city of Bethsaida.
The crowds followed him and he welcomed them. He spoke to them about the kingdom of God. He healed many who were sick.
As the day wore on the twelve came to him and said: "Send the people away, that they may go into the villages and country nearby to find lodging and get food, for we are here in a lonely place."
He said to them: "You feed them." They replied: "We have no more than five loaves and two fishes unless we should go and buy food for all these people."
There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.
They did so, and made them all sit down.
He took the five loaves and the two fishes. Looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke the bread. Then he gave them to the disciples to pass out to the crowd.
They ate and were all filled. Twelve baskets of left over pieces remained.
After he prayed the disciples went to him. He asked them: "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
They said: "John the Baptist. Others say Elijah and still others say one of the old prophets has risen again."
"But who do you say I am?" He asked. Peter answered him: "The Christ of God."
He commanded them to tell this to no man.
The Son of man must suffer many things, he told them. The elders, chief priests and scribes will reject him and kill him. The third day he will be raised up.
He told them all: "If any man would come after me let him deny himself. Let him take up his stake of self-denial daily, and follow me.
"He who would save his life shall lose it. He who would lose his life for my sake shall save it.
"For what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?
"If any man is ashamed of my teachings, and of me the Son of man will be ashamed of that person. This will happen when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.
"I tell you the truth, there are some here who shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God."
About eight days after he said these things he took Peter, John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
While he prayed his appearance changed and his clothes became white and brilliant.
Moses and Elijah talked to him.
They appeared in glory and spoke about the death he was about to experience at Jerusalem.
Peter and his companions were very sleepy. When they awoke they saw his brilliance and the two men that stood with him.
Before they left Peter said to Jesus: "Master it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles. We could make one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah." He did not know what he was saying.
While he said these things a cloud enveloped them and they were filled with fear.
A voice came out of the cloud saying: "This is my Son my chosen one. Listen to him!"
When the voice came Jesus was found alone. They kept quiet and told no man what they had seen.
After they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him.
A man in the crowd cried, "Teacher, please look at my son. He is my only child.
"A spirit controls him and suddenly he cries out. He foams at the mouth. It throws him into convulsions and he is badly bruised.
"I asked your disciples to cast it out and they could not."
Jesus answered: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring your son to me."
When he came near the demon slammed him down and through him in to a convulsion. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
They were all overwhelmed by the greatness of God. Everyone marveled at all the things he did. Jesus said to his disciples:
"Let these words sink into your ears. The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men."
They did not understand what he said. The meaning was concealed from them. They could not comprehend it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.
They reasoned among themselves which of them was the greatest.
When Jesus detected the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side.
Then he said to them: "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. He who is least among you will be the greatest!"
John said: "Master we saw some one casting out demons in your name. So we prevented him from doing this because he does not follow us."
Jesus said: "Do not forbid him for he that is not against you is for you."
The days were approaching for his ascension. He was determined to go to Jerusalem.
He sent messengers ahead of him. They entered the village of the Samaritans to get ready for him.
They did not receive him because he traveled to Jerusalem.
When his disciples James and John saw this they said: "Lord, do you want us to request fire from heaven to consume them?"
He turned and rebuked them.
They went to another village.
On the way a man came to him and said: "I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus told him: "Foxes have holes and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head."
He told another: "Follow me." But he said: "Lord first let me go bury my father."
"Let the dead bury the dead. You go and publish abroad the kingdom of God." Jesus replied.
Another said: "I will follow you Lord, but first let me go say good by to my relatives."
Jesus responded: "No man, who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
The Lord appointed seventy disciples and sent them in groups of two into every city and place where he was about to go.
He said to them: "The harvest indeed is great but the laborers are few. Pray that the Master Controller Lord of the harvest will send laborers into his harvest.
"Go your way for I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.
"Carry no purse, no wallet, and no shoes; and greet no man on the way.
"When you enter a house say; may this house have peace.
"If a son of peace lives there, your peace shall rest upon him. If not, it shall return to you again.
"Remain in that house eating and drinking what they give you. The laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not stay in different houses.
"When they receive you in their city eat what ever they set before you.
"Heal the sick that are there and say to them, the kingdom of God is near you.
"If they do not receive you in their city go into their streets and,
"Shake off the dust that clings to your feet, from that city, so they may know that the kingdom of God came near.
"I tell you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
"Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
"It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
"Will you Capernaum be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to the grave.
"He that hears you hears me; and he that rejects you rejects me and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me."
The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name."
He said to them: "I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven.
"Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any way hurt you.
"Do not rejoice about this that the spirits are subject to you. Rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
In that same hour he rejoiced in Holy Spirit and said: "I thank you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you did hide these things from the wise and the understanding and revealed them to babes. Father, it is pleasing in your sight.
"All things have been delivered to me from my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father. And no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him."
Turning to the disciples, he said privately: "Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see.
"I tell you many prophets and kings desired to see the things you see and did not see them. To hear the things you hear and did not hear them."
A lawyer stood up to test him. He asked: "Teacher what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?"
He said: "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"
He answered: "Love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your life, with all your strength and with all your mind. Feelings and total existence Might and total thinking capacity And you should love your neighbor as yourself."
He told him: "You answered correctly, do this and you will live."
Desiring to justify himself, he said to Jesus: "Who is my neighbor?"
Jesus answered: "A man traveled from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell among robbers. They stripped him, beat him and left him half dead.
"A priest traveled on that road. When he saw him he passed by on the other side.
"When a Levite came to the place he saw the man and passed by on the other side.
"Then a Samaritan arrived where he was. He was moved with compassion when he saw him.
"He went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn to take care of him.
"The next day he paid the host two shillings. He said take care of him and if you spend more I will repay you when I return.
"Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?"
He said: "The one who showed mercy to him." Jesus said to him: "Go and you do like wise."
Along the way he entered a village. A woman named Martha received him into her house.
Her sister Mary sat at the Lord’s feet and heard his word.
Martha was worried about the housework. She approached Jesus and said: "Lord do you not care that my sister does not help me? Tell her to help me."
The Lord answered: "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
"However one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the proper way and it shall not be taken away from her."
Jesus was praying. When he finished one of his disciples said to him: "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
He said: "When you pray say, ‘ Father holy sacred sanctified blessed consecrated is your name. Let your kingdom come.
"Give us day-by-day our daily bread.
"Forgive us our sins. For we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And keep us from temptation."
He also said: "Which of you have a friend you would approach at midnight and say lend me three loaves.
"This is because a friend of mine is visiting and I do not have any food to feed him.
"You hear a voice from the house say, ‘ The door is shut, my children are in bed, do not bother me. I cannot rise and help you. ’"
"I tell you even if he will not rise and give you what you need because he is your friend, he will arise and give you what you need because you keep asking.
"I say to you: Ask and it will be given you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you.
"Every one who asks receives. Everyone who seeks will find. It will be opened to everyone who knocks.
"What father would give his son a stone when he asked for a loaf? What father would give a serpent when his son asked for a fish?
"If he asked for an egg would he give a scorpion?
"If you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
He cast out a demon from a dumb man. When the demon left the man he spoke and the crowds were astonished.
Some of them said: "Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts out demons."
Others tested him demanding a sign from heaven.
He knew their thoughts. So he told them: "Every kingdom that is divided is destroyed. A house divided against itself falls.
"If Satan is divided against himself how will his kingdom stand? You say I cast out demons with the help of Beelzebub.
"If Beelzebub helps me cast out demons, who helps your sons cast them out? They will be your judges.
"If I use the finger power Spirit of God to cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you?
"When the fully armed strong man guards his own palace, his goods are safe.
"When some one stronger comes to him and overpowers him he takes away his armor and steels his possessions.
"He who is not with me is against me. He who does not help me gather actually scatters.
"When an unclean spirit leaves a man it passes through desolate places. It seeks rest and finds none. It says, ‘ I will return from where I came. ’
"When he returns he finds the place swept and adorned.
"He then takes seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell. The last condition of that man becomes worse than the first."
As he was talking a woman out of the crowd shouted: "Blessed is the woman who bore you and nursed you."
He replied: "More blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it."
When the crowd gathered to him, he said: "This generation is evil. It seeks a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
"Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites; the Son of man will be a sign to this generation.
"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation. She will condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the Wisdom of Solomon and one greater than Solomon is here now.
"The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation. They will condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and someone greater than Jonah is here now.
"No man lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a bushel. He puts it on a table so those who enter may see the light.
"The lamp of your body is your eye. When your eye is clear your entire body is full of light. When it is evil your body is full of darkness.
"Make sure the light that is in you is not darkness.
If your entire body is full of light and has no darkness you will have no part of the dark. Just as a lamp when shinning brightly gives plenty of light."
As he spoke a Pharisee invited him to dine with him. He accepted the invitation and went to eat.
The Pharisee wondered about Jesus not bathing before dinner.
The Lord said: "You Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter. Yet your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
"You foolish ones. Did he that made the outside also make the inside?
« Give that which is within as charity. Then all things are clean for you.
"Woe to you Pharisees! You tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God. You should have done these but you leave them undone.
"Woe to you Pharisees! You love the prominent seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
"Woe to you! You are as the tombs that do not appear and men walk over them and do not know it."
One of the lawyers said to him: "Teacher, you also insult us by saying this."
Jesus said: "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to bear. And you will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
"Therefore you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers. They killed them and you build their tombs.
"It is for this reason the wisdom of God said, ‘ I send to them prophets and apostles and they will persecute and kill some of them. ’
"The blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation.
"This includes the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. I tell you it will be required of this generation.
"Woe to you lawyers, for you took away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves and you hindered those entering."
When he left there the scribes and the Pharisees became hostile with him. They tried to quarrel with him about many things.
They plotted against him and tried to catch him in something he might say.
Thousands of people in the crowd were gathered together so much that they bumped into one another. He said to his disciples: "First of all, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
"Everything covered up will be revealed. Everything hidden will be made known.
"That which you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. That which you have spoken in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.
"I tell you my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body. After that they can do no more.
"I will show you the one to fear. Fear the one who, after he has killed, has power to destroy you throw into the ever-burning trash fires of the valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna. This is one you should fear.
"Are not five sparrows sold for two coins of small value? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
"Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.
"I tell you, every one who confesses me before men; the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.
"He who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
"He who speaks against the Son of man will be forgiven. However he who blasphemes against Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"When you are brought before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about what you will say to answer them.
"Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should say."
A member of the crowd said: "Teacher, help my brother divide the inheritance with me."
Then he said: "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
Jesus said: "Be careful, do not covet, for life does not come from your possessions."
He spoke an illustration to them: "The land of a rich man produced well.
"He reasoned to himself, what will I do? I have nowhere to store my fruits?
"He said: "I would pull down my barns and build larger barns. I will store all my grain and goods there.
"I will say to my self: ‘ You have many possessions saved for many years. Take it easy and eat, drink and be merry. ’
"But God said to him: ‘ You fool this night you will give up your life. Then who will have all these things you accumulated? ’
"He who lays up earthly treasure for himself is not rich toward God."
He told his disciples: "Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you eat or what you wear on your body.
"Life is more than food and clothing.
"Consider the ravens for they do not sow or reap. They have no storehouse or barn. Yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!
"Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to your life?
"If you are not able to do even that which is least why worry about the rest?
"Consider the way the lilies grow. They do not toil and neither do they spin. Yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
"If God clothes the grasses in the field, which is here today and is cast into the oven tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you? You have little faith.
"Do not seek food and drink and do not worry.
"For the people of the nations seek after these things. Your Father knows that you need them.
"Seek first his kingdom and these things will be added to you.
"Do not fear little flock for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
"Sell your possessions and give to charity. Make yourselves purses that do not get old, a treasure in heaven where moth and rest cannot corrupt and thieves cannot steal.
"Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"Gird your loins strengthen yourselves and light your lamps.
"Be like men looking for their master to return. He will knock when he returns from the marriage feast, and it will immediately be opened to him.
"Those servants are blessed, for the master will find them alert when he comes. I tell you he will tighten his belt, have them sit down at the table, and he will serve them the meal.
"Even if he comes in the second watch or the third and he finds the same his servants are blessed.
"Know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched. He would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
"You be ready! The Son of man will come at a time when you do not think he will."
Peter said: "Lord are you speaking this illustration to us or to everyone?"
The Lord said: "Who is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master shall appoint over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
"That servant will be blessed when his master comes and finds him doing so.
"I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all that he has.
"If that servant says in his heart, my master delays his coming; and beats the other servants and eats and drinks to excess,
the master of that servant will come when he does not expect. He will come in an hour that he does not know. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
"The unfaithful servant who knew what his master wanted and did not do it will be beaten.
"He who did not know and did things unacceptable will receive a lesser punishment. To whom much is given, much will be required and to whom they commit much they will demand even more.
« I came to strike fire upon the earth and what do I care if it is already kindled?
"I have a baptism to experience and I am distressed until it is accomplished!
"Do you think I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, No, instead division.
"From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
"They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law."
He said to the crowd: "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say it will rain and it does.
"When you see a south wind blowing, you say there will be scorching heat and there is.
"You hypocrites, you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven but how is it that you do not know how to interpret this time?
"Why do you not judge what is right?
"For example when an opponent brings you to court, try to settle before you get there. Otherwise, he will drag you in front of a judge and the judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison.
"I tell you that you will not get out until you pay every penny of your fine."
Some people there gave him an account of how Pilate killed some Galilaeans while they offered sacrifices.
Jesus said: "Do you think the way those Galileans were killed prove they were worse sinners than all Galileans?
"It does not! I tell you; if you do not turn from your sins, you will die as they did.
"What about the eighteen people in Siloam killed when the castle tower fell on them? Do you think this proves that they were worse than all the other people living in Jerusalem?
"It does not! I tell you if you do not turn from your sins, you will die as they did."
Jesus told them an illustration: "There was a man who had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. He looked for figs on it but found none.
"So he told his gardener, I have been coming here looking for figs on this tree for three years. I have not found any. So cut it down! Why should it continue using the soil?
"But the gardener said: Just give it one more year, sir. I will dig around it, fertilize it and leave it alone.
"If the tree bears figs next year it will be good. If it does not you can have it cut down."
Jesus was teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath.
A woman had an evil spirit that kept her sick for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not stand straight.
Jesus called to her: "Woman you are free from your sickness!"
He touched her and at once she stood straight up and praised God.
The official of the synagogue was angry that Jesus healed on the Sabbath. He told the people: "There are six days in which we should work. Come during those days and be healed, not on the Sabbath!"
The Lord answered: "You hypocrites! You would untie your ox or your donkey from the stall and take it out to give it water on the Sabbath.
"Here is a descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept in bonds for eighteen years. Should she be released on the Sabbath?"
His answer shamed his enemies. The people rejoiced over the wonderful things he did.
Jesus continued: "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God? What is it like?"
"It is like this. A man plants a mustard seed in his field. The plant grows and becomes a tree. The birds make their nests in its branches."
Again Jesus asked: "With what should I compare the Kingdom of God?
« It is like this. A woman takes some yeast and mixes it with a bushel of flour. Soon the whole batch of dough rises."
Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching the people and traveling toward Jerusalem.
Someone asked him, "Will only a few people be saved?" Jesus answered them:
"Strive to go in through the narrow door. Many people will try to go in and will not be able.
"The master of the house will close the door. You stand outside and knock on the door and say: ‘ Open the door for us, sir! ’ ’ He will answer: ‘ I do not know where you come from! ’
"Then you will answer, we ate and drank with you. You taught in our town!
"Again he will say: ‘ I do not know where you come from. Get away from me, you wicked people! ’
"You will cry and grind your teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, while you are thrown out!
"People will come from east, west, north and south and sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God.
"Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last."
Some Pharisees came to Jesus and warned him: "You must leave and go somewhere else for Herod wants to kill you."
Jesus told them: "Go tell that fox I cast out demons and heal people today and tomorrow. On the third day my work will be finished.
« I must go on my way today, tomorrow and the following day. It would not be right that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets! You stone those sent to you. How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her own brood under her wings. But you would not have it!
"Behold, your house is made desolate. I tell you, you shall not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah."
Shortly after that he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees. They were there to eat on the Sabbath. They watched him.
There was in his presence a man who had the dropsy swollen arms and legs.
Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees: "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"
They did not speak. So he held the man and healed him and let him go.
He said: "Which of you who has an ass or a bull that falls into a well, and will not immediately pull him up on a Sabbath day?"
Again they could not answer.
He spoke an illustration to the invited guests. He noticed they chose from the most important seats. So he said to them:
"When you are invited to a marriage feast do not take the place of honor. Someone more distinguished than you may be invited.
"Your host would tell you, give this person your place. Then you would be embarrassed and have to take the place of least honor.
"When you are invited, take the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, friend, move to a more honorable place. And the other guests will see how you are honored.
"Those who exalt themselves will be humbled. And people who humble themselves will be exalted."
Jesus said to his host: "When you give a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors. They will invite you back, and in this way you will be paid for what you did.
"When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
"You will be blessed because they are not able to pay you back. God will repay you on the day the good people rise from death."
One of the guests at the table then said to Jesus: "Those who sit down at the feast in the Kingdom of God will be happy!"
Jesus said: "There was a man who gave a great feast to which he invited many people.
"He sent his servant to tell the guests that everything is ready.
"They all made excuses one after another. The first one told the servant: ‘ I bought a field and must go and look at it. Please accept my apologies. ’
"Another said: ‘ I purchased five pairs of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please accept my apologies. ’
"Another explained: ‘ I am newly married and I cannot come. ’
"The servant returned and conveyed this to his master. The master was furious. He commanded his servant to hurry into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring back the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.
"The servant soon told his master, ‘ Your order has been carried out but there is still more room. ’
"The master told the servant, ‘ Go to the country roads and lanes and make people come so my house will be full. ’
"None of those who were invited will taste my dinner!" He said.
Jesus turned to speak to the large crowd of people who were traveling with him:
"You who come to me may not be my disciple unless you love me more than you love your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters and yourself.
"Those who do not carry their own stake and come after me may not be my disciples.
"If you plan to build a tower, you sit down first and figure out what it will cost. Then you see if you have enough money to finish the job.
"If you do not, you will not be able to finish the project after laying the foundation. Everyone who sees what happened will ridicule and poke fun of you.
"‘ You started and could not finish, ’ ’ they will say.
« When a king commands ten thousand men to fight another king who comes against him with twenty thousand men, he will sit down first and decide if he is strong enough to defeat the other king.
"If he is not strong enough he will send messengers to the other king to ask for terms of peace while he is still far away."
"Likewise," concluded Jesus, "none of you may be my disciples unless you give up everything you have."
"Salt is good. But if it loses its saltiness it cannot be made salty again.
"It is neither good for the soil nor for the manure pile. You throw it away. Listen if you have ears!"
One day a large number of tax collectors and other outcasts came to listen to Jesus.
Pharisees and teachers of the Law complained: "This man welcomes sinners and even eats with them!"
Then Jesus told them an illustration:
"If you have a hundred sheep and lose one of them, what do you do? You leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the pasture and go looking for the one you lost until you find it.
"When you find it you are happy. You carry it on your shoulders.
"You bring it back home. You invite your friends and neighbors together to celebrate. You say, ‘ I am so happy I found my lost sheep. ’
"It is the same. I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine good people who do not need to repent.
"Suppose a woman with ten silver coins loses one of them. What does she do? She lights a lamp and sweeps her house. She looks carefully everywhere until she finds it.
"When she finds it she calls her friends and says let us celebrate. I am happy I found the lost coin.
"I tell you, it is the same for the angels of God who rejoice over one sinner who repents."
Jesus said: "A man had two sons.
"The younger one said to him, Father I want my share of the property. He divided his property between his two sons.
"In a short time the younger son sold his share of the property. He left home with the money and traveled to a far away country where he wasted his money in reckless living.
"He spent everything! When a famine spread over that country he was left with nothing.
"He went to work for a citizen of that country who sent him to his farm to take care of the pigs.
He wanted to eat the Carob bean pods the pigs ate, but no one gave him anything to eat.
"Finally it dawned on him, my father’s hired workers have more than they can eat and I am about to starve!
"I will go to my father and say: ‘ Father I have sinned against God and against you.
"I am not fit to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired workers. ’
"He went to his father. He was a long way from home when his father saw him. His heart filled with pity. He ran and threw his arms around his son and kissed him.
"Father, the son said: ‘ I have sinned against God and against you. I am not fit to be called your son. ’
"The father called his servants. He said: ‘ Hurry and bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet.
"‘ Get the prize calf and kill it. Let us celebrate with a feast!
"‘ My son was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he has been found. The feasting began. ’
"The older son was out in the field. When he came close to the house he heard music and dancing.
« He asked one of the servants what was happening?
"Your brother returned home, the servant answered. Your father killed the prize calf because he has returned safely.
"The older brother was so angry he would not enter the house. His father came out and begged him to come in.
"He spoke to his father in anger. All these years I have worked like a slave for you. I have never disobeyed you. What have you given me? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends!
"This son of yours wasted all your property on prostitutes. When he comes home you kill the prize calf for him!
"The father answered, "My son, you are always here. And everything I have is yours!
"‘ We had to celebrate and be happy. Your brother was dead. Now he is alive! He was lost and now he has been found! ’"
Jesus told his disciples: "There was a rich man who had a servant who managed his property. The rich man learned that the manager was accused of wasting his master’s money.
"He said: ‘ Is it true what I hear about you? Give me a complete accounting of your management of my property for you may not be my manager any longer. ’
"The servant thought: ‘ I am fired from my job. What shall I do? I am not strong enough for heavy work and I am ashamed to beg.
"‘ I know what I will do when my job is gone. My friends will welcome me in their homes. ’
"He called all the people who were in debt to his master. He asked the first one: ‘ How much do you owe my master? ’
"‘ One hundred barrels of olive oil, ’ ’ he said. ‘ Here is your bill, ’ ’ he told him; ‘ settle for fifty. ’
"He asked another: ‘ How much do you owe? ’ ’ ‘ A thousand bushels of wheat, ’ ’ he answered. ‘ Here is your bill. Pay eight hundred bushels. ’
"The master of the dishonest manager praised him for doing a shrewd thing. People of this world are more astute at handling their affairs than people who belong to the light.
Jesus continued: "I tell you, make friends for yourselves with worldly wealth. That way when it gives out, you will be welcomed in the eternal home.
"Whoever is faithful in little things will be faithful in large ones. Whoever is unrighteous in small things will be unrighteous in large ones.
"If you have not been faithful in handling worldly wealth, how can you be trusted with true wealth?
"If you have not been faithful with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what belongs to you?
"No one can serve two masters. He will hate one and love the other. He will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
Hearing this the Pharisees made fun of Jesus, because they loved money.
Jesus said: "You make yourselves look righteous to other people. God knows your hearts. The things considered of great value by people are worth nothing in God’s sight.
"The Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets was in effect until John the Baptist. From that time on the Good News about the Kingdom of God is being taught.
« It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest detail of the Law to be eliminated.
"A man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. The man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Jesus continued to tell illustrations.
"A rich man dressed in the most expensive clothes and lived in great luxury every day.
"A poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, used to be brought to the rich man’s door.
"He hoped he could eat the bits of food that fell from the rich man’s table. Then the dogs would come and lick his sores.
"The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man died and was buried.
"He was in great torment in the grave hades. He looked up and saw Abraham, far away, with Lazarus at his side.
"He called out: Father Abraham! Take pity on me! Please send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool off my tongue. I am in torment in this fire!
"Abraham said: Remember, my son, in your lifetime you were given good things, while Lazarus got all the bad things. Now he is enjoying himself while you are in torment.
"There is a deep pit lying between us, so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so. And no one can cross over to us from where you are.
"The rich man said: I beg you, father Abraham, send Lazarus to my father’s house.
"Have him go warn my five brothers that they will not come to this place of torment.
"Abraham said: Your brothers have Moses and the prophets to warn them. They should listen to them.
« The rich man responded: It is not enough father Abraham! If someone from the dead went to them they would repent.
"Abraham said: If they would not listen to Moses and the prophets, they would not listen to someone from the dead."
Jesus told his disciples: "Things that cause people to stumble do happen. However it is a terrible thing for someone to make them happen!
"It would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.
"So watch how you behave. Admonish your brother to repent when he sins. Forgive him when he repents.
"If he sins against you seven times in one day and repents each time, you must forgive him."
The apostles said to the Lord: "Increase our faith."
He answered: "If your faith was as big as a mustard seed; you could say to this mulberry tree, uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea and it would obey you!
"Let us say you have a servant who is plowing or looking after the sheep. Do you tell him to hurry and eat his meal when he comes in from the field?
"No you do not. You say to him get my supper ready. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. After that you may have your meal.
Does the servant deserve thanks for obeying orders?
The same applies to you. When you have done all you have been told to do, you say, we are unworthy servants. We have done what we ought to have done."
Jesus traveled to Jerusalem. He went along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
Entering a village he met ten men suffering from a dreaded skin disease.
They shouted: "Jesus! Master! Have pity on us!"
When he saw them he told them to go show themselves to the priests. They were cleansed on the way.
When he was healed, one of them came back and praised God in a loud voice.
He fell on his face at Jesus feet and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.
Jesus answered: "Were all ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
"Were the others not willing to return with this foreigner to give glory to God?
He said: "Arise and go your way. Your faith has made you whole."
The Pharisees asked: "When does the kingdom of God come?" Jesus answered them: "The kingdom of God does not come with observable signs.
"Neither shall they say it is here or over there! The kingdom of God is here with you in your midst among you."
He said to the disciples: "The time will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.
"They will tell you go here or go there, but do not follow them.
"Just as the light from lightning shines from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, so the Son of man will be in his day.
"First he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
"The days of the Son of man will be like the days of Noah.
"They ate, they drank and they got married until Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came, and destroyed them all.
"The days of Lot were similar. They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted and they built.
"But when Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
"It will be similar in the day that the Son of man is revealed.
"A man will be on the housetop. He should not go down into the house to take his possessions. He that is in the field should likewise not return to the house.
"Remember Lot’s wife!
"He who seeks to gain his life will lose it. He who loses his life will preserve it.
"I tell you, that on that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken learn be received and the other will be left omited forsaken.
"There will be two grinding together. One will be taken and the other will be left.
"There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other will be left."
They asked him: "Where, Lord?" And he said to them: "Where the body is the eagles will also gather."
He spoke an illustration to them emphasizing the need to pray and not become tired:
"There was a judge in a city that did not fear God and had no respect for man.
"There was a widow in that same city. She went to him asking for legal protection from her adversary.
"At first he refused. Then he thought about it and he said to himself, I do not fear God and have little respect for man.
"However this widow bothers me. For this reason I will avenge her. If she keeps coming to me she will wear me out."
The Lord continued: "Pay attention to what the unrighteous judge said."
"Should God avenge his chosen that cry to him day and night, and yet he is longsuffering over them?
"I say to you, that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, will the Son of man find faith on the earth when he comes? »
He then spoke this illustration to some who trusted in themselves. They were very self-righteous. They looked down on others:
"Two men went to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.
"The Pharisee stood and prayed like this: God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.
"I fast twice per week. I give tithes of all that I get.
"But the tax collector stood far away and would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven. He beat his breast, saying: God, be merciful to me a sinner.
"I tell you the tax collector and not the Pharisee was right with God when he went home. He who exalts himself will be humbled! He who humbles himself will be exalted!"
They brought all their babes to him that he should touch them. When the disciples saw it they rebuked them.
Jesus said: "Invite the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them for the kingdom of God belongs to them.
"Truly I tell you he who does not receive the kingdom of God like little child, shall in no wise enter it."
A Jewish leader asked: "Good Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus asked: "Why do you call me good? None is good except one, God.
"You know the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, and do not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother."
The man replied: "I have observed all these things from my youth."
When Jesus heard it he said to him, "You lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
But when he heard these things he became very sad for he was very rich.
Seeing him Jesus said: "It is very difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
"It is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
They heard this and asked: "Than who can be saved?"
He replied: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God."
Peter said: "Indeed we have left our own to follow you."
Jesus said: "Truly I tell you, no man has left house, or wife, or brother, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
who shall not receive manifold more now and in the age to come everlasting life."
He took the twelve to Jerusalem so that the Son of man will accomplish all the things that are written through the prophets:
"He will be delivered up to the people of the nations, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon.
"They will beat and kill him. The third day he will rise."
They did not understand for the meaning was hidden from them. They could not perceive the things he said.
He came closer to Jericho where a blind man sat begging by the side or the road.
Hearing a crowd go by, he inquired what this meant.
They told him: "Jesus of Nazareth passed by."
He cried out: "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
They rebuked him and said he should keep quiet. But he cried out even more: "You son of David, have mercy on me!"
Jesus commanded that he be brought to him. When he was near he spoke to him.
What do you want me to do to you? He said: "Lord, give me my sight!"
And Jesus said to him: "Receive your sight! Your faith has made you whole."
Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people who saw it praised God.
Jesus passed through Jericho.
There was an important, wealthy, chief tax collector called Zacchaeus.
He tried to see who Jesus was. Being a short person he could not see over the crowd.
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig-mulberry tree near where he would pass by in order to see him.
When Jesus came to the place he looked up at Zacchaeus and said: "Come down quickly for today I must visit your home."
He hurried down to receive him joyfully.
Many in the crowd complained saying: "He is staying with a man who is a sinner."
Zacchaeus stood before Jesus and said: "Lord, I now give half of all my possessions to the poor. If I have defrauded any one I will give back four times the amount taken."
Jesus said to him: "Salvation has come to this house today. He is also a son of Abraham.
"The Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost."
They were close to Jerusalem. They assumed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. Jesus responded to their assumption with an illustration.
He said: "A nobleman traveled to a country far away to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
"He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds, and said do business with this until I return.
"His citizens hated him. They sent a spokesman to him saying we do not want this man to rule us.
"He received the kingdom and went back to check on his servants. He wanted to know what they had gained by trading with the money he gave them.
"The first reported: Your pound has made ten pounds more.
"He said: Well done, you good servant. You were faithful in very little. Now you shall have authority over ten cities.
"The second said: Your pound, Lord, has made five pounds.
"He replied: You should be over five cities.
"Another reported: Lord, here is your pound. I kept it stored in a napkin.
"I feared you because you are an austere man. You take up what you do not lay down and you reap that which you did not sow.
"He said to him: Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.
"Why did you not put my money in the bank? That way I could collect interest when I returned.
"The nobleman said: Take away the pound he was given and give it to him that has the ten pounds.
"They said: Lord he has ten pounds!
"I say to you, that every one who has more shall be given. The man who does not have what little he has shall be taken away from him.
"Bring my enemies that do not want me to rule over them and kill them in front of me."
After Jesus spoke he went to Jerusalem.
When he came close to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples.
He told them, "Go into the nearby village. You will find a colt tied. No man has ever sat on him. Untie him and bring him to me.
"If any one asks why you untied him say the Lord needs him."
They left and found things to be as he said.
The owners found them when they untied the colt and asked why do you untie the colt?
They said: "The Lord needs him."
They brought him to Jesus. Then they threw their garments on the colt and Jesus sat on him.
As he went, they spread their garments in the way.
He was near the descent of the Mount of Olives. The entire crowd of disciples rejoiced and praised God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen.
They said: "Blessed is the King that comes in the name of Jehovah! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!"
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
He answered: "I tell you if these remain quiet the stones will cry out!"
When he came close to the city he wept over it.
He said: "If you only knew today the things needed to bring peace! But they are hidden from your eyes.
"The time is coming when your enemies will surround you and blockade you with a rampart wall on all sides. They will close in on you.
"They will knock you and your children down to the ground. They will not leave one stone upon another. What’s more you do not know when this visit will take place."
Jesus entered the temple and drove out the merchants.
He said: "It is written my house shall be a house of prayer. You have made it a den of robbers."
Everyday he taught in the temple. The chief priests, scribes and other important men of the people looked for ways to destroy him.
They could not find a way for the people listened to every thing he said.
One day when he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the good news he saw the chief priests, scribes and elders.
They said to him: "Tell us by what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus responded: "I also will ask you a question. Tell me,
"The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men?"
They reasoned among themselves, "If we say from heaven; he will say why did you not believe him?
"If we say from men all the people will stone us. They are persuaded that John was a prophet."
So they answered: "We do not know."
Jesus said: "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
He told the people an illustration: "A man planted a vineyard. He rented it to tenants and went to another country for a long time.
"At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters to collect fruit of the vineyard. The renters beat him, and sent him away empty.
"He sent another servant who was also treated shamefully, beaten and sent away empty.
"A third servant was sent. They wounded him and threw him out.
"The owner of the vineyard said, what should I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.
"When the renters saw him they reasoned that this is the heir, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
"They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
He will come and destroy the renters and will give the vineyard to others. When they heard it, they said, God forbid!
"He looked at them and asked what does the scripture mean: The stone that the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner?
"Every one that falls on that stone shall be broken to pieces. Every one the stone falls on will be scattered as dust."
The scribes and the chief priests attempted to capture him in that very hour. They feared the people. They perceived that he spoke this illustration against them.
They watched him and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous. The spies listened for something in his speech to deliver him up to the authority of the governor.
"Teacher," they said, "we know that you are right in what you say and teach. You are not partial and do not play favorites. Rather you teach the way of God truthfully."
"Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
He perceived their craftiness, and replied:
"Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have?" They said, "Caesar’s."
He said to them: "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s."
They were not able to apprehend him in front of the people. They were amazed by his answer and kept quiet.
Some Sadducees came to him. They believe there is no resurrection.
They asked him: "Teacher, Moses wrote if a man’s brother dies and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed for his brother.
"There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
"The same for the second.
"The third married her. The remaining of the seven also married her, left no children and died.
"Afterward the woman also died.
"In the resurrection whose wife shall she be? All seven married her."
Jesus said, "The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
"Those accounted worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
"They cannot die anymore for they are equal to the angels. They are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
"Even Moses showed that the dead are raised when he was near the bush and he called Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live for him."
Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher you have said well."
They did not dare to ask any more questions.
He asked them a question: "How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?
"For David said in the book of Psalms: Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand.
"Till I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
"David therefore called him Lord, and how is he his son?"
He spoke to the disciples while all the people listened:
"Beware of the scribes for they walk around in long robes. They love greetings in the marketplaces. They sit in the chief seats in the synagogues and the head tables at feasts.
"They devour widows’ houses. They offer long prayers to show off in front of others. They shall receive great condemnation."
He saw rich men putting their gifts into the treasury.
Then he saw a poor widow putting in two small coins.
"I tell you a truth," he said: "This poor widow gave more than all of them.
"They all gave out of their surplus but she gave out of her poverty. She gave all that she had for living expenses."
Some spoke of how wonderful the temple was. How it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus replied:
"Concerning these things you see, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
They asked him: "Teacher, when would these things take place? What will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass?"
He said: "Take heed that you are not led astray. Many will come in my name, saying, I am he but the time is not at hand. Do not follow them.
"When you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified. These things must occur first. The end is not immediate."
Then he said: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
"There will be great earthquakes. There will be famines and pestilences in various places. There shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.
"Even before all these things, they will capture you, and persecute you. You will be delivered to synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
"It will give you an opportunity to witness.
"Do not think about what you will say before it happens.
"I will give you ability to talk and words of wisdom, which your adversaries shall not be able to resist or refute.
"Parent, brothers and sisters and friends will turn you over and cause you to be put to death.
"Men will hate you because of my name.
"Yet not a hair of your head will perish.
"You will gain your lives because of your endurance.
"When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies you will know that desolation is near.
"Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her leave. And let no one from the country enter.
"These are days of vengeance! All things written will be fulfilled.
"Woe to those who are pregnant and those who nurse a child in those days! There will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.
"They will be killed by the edge of the sword. Some will be led captive into all the nations. The people of the nations will tread down Jerusalem until the time of the Nations is fulfilled.
"There will be signs in sun and moon and stars. The earth will experience distress of nations in disarray for the roaring of the sea and the waves.
"Men will faint out of fear for expectation of the things coming on the world. The powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
"Then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
"When these things begin to happen lift up your heads because your redemption draws near."
He told them an illustration: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
"When they produce leaves you know that summer is near.
"Even so, when you see these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near!
"Truly I say to you, this generation shall not pass away, till all things are accomplished.
"Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will not pass away.
"Be awake so your hearts are not weighed down. Do not allow the weight of worldly involvement, drunkenness, and cares of this life be a snare when that day suddenly comes.
"It will come as a surprise to all who dwell on the face of the earth.
"Be on the watch all the time. Pray for the strength to escape all these things in order to stand before the Son of man."
He taught in the temple every day and he stayed on the Mount of Olives at night.
The people came early in the morning to hear him in the temple.
The feast of unleavened bread was near. This is called the Passover.
The chief priests and the scribes searched for a way to put him to death. But they feared the people.
Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot. He was one of the twelve.
He went away to discuss with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver Jesus to them.
They were glad, and pledged to give him money.
He consented and looked for a way to deliver him to them in the absence of the crowd.
The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: "Go make everything ready that we may eat the Passover."
They asked him: "Where do you want us to get ready?"
He said: "When you enter the city a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house.
"Say to the master of the house: The teacher says; ‘ where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples? ’
"He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make it ready."
They found things as he described them and they made things ready for the Passover.
When it was time he sat down with the apostles.
He said to them: "I have earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I die.
"I tell you I will not eat it again until it takes place in the kingdom of God."
He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said: "Take this, and share it among yourselves.
"I say to you, I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God comes."
He gave thanks. Then he took the bread, broke it and gave it to them, saying: "This represents my body that is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
Then he took the cup saying:" This represents the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
"Look, he who betrays me is at the table.
"The Son of man indeed goes, as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"
They questioned among themselves, which of them would do this thing.
Contention grew between them concerning which of them was the greatest.
He told them: "The kings of the nations have lordship over them. Those who have authority over them are called Benefactors.
"But you should not be this way. He who is the greater among you let him become as the younger. He that is chief among you is he who serves.
"Which is greater, he who sits and eats or he who serves? Is it he who sits and eats? However I am in the midst of you as he who serves.
"You have continued with me in my temptations.
"I assigned a kingdom to you just as my Father assigned it to me.
"Just as you eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.
"I prayed for you that your faith would not fail. Once you have turned again strengthen your brothers."
He said: "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death."
Jesus said: "I tell you Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until you deny that you know me three times."
Speaking to them he asked: "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?" They said: "Nothing."
Now he said: "Take your purse and wallet. If you do not have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.
"I tell you that which is written must be fulfilled in me. He was numbered with transgressors for that which concerns me has fulfillment."
They said: "Lord, here are two swords." And he said to them: "It is enough."
He went to the Mount of Olives as was his custom and the disciples also followed him.
When he arrived he said to them: "Pray that you do not enter into temptation."
He went a short distance from them and kneeled down and prayed.
He prayed: "Father if it is your will remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will, but your will be done."
An angel came to him and gave him strength.
When he finished his prayer he went to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of their sorrow.
He said: "Why do you sleep? Arise and pray that you do not enter into temptation."
As he spoke a crowd followed Judas, one of the twelve. They came to him. Judas approached Jesus and kissed him.
Jesus said to him: "Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?"
Those near him saw what happened and asked: "Lord shall we strike them with a sword?"
One of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
Jesus said: "Do not do any more of this." Then he touched his ear and healed him.
Jesus spoke to the chief priests, captains of the temple and elders who came against him: "Did you come as you would against a robber with swords and clubs?
"I was with you every day in the temple. Yet you did not lift a hand against me. This is your hour for this power of darkness."
They seized him and led him away. They took him to the high priest’s house. Peter followed from a distance.
They kindled a fire in the midst of the court. They sat down together. Peter sat in the midst of them.
A servant girl saw him sitting by the light of the fire. She looked steadfastly upon him and said: "This man was also with him."
He denied it saying: "Woman, I do not know him!"
After a little while another saw him, and said: "You are one of them." Peter replied: "Man I am not!"
Another hour passed. Someone else said: "It is true this man was with him for he is a Galilean."
Peter responded: "I do not know what you are talking about!" Immediately, while he spoke he heard the cockcrow.
The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him: "Before the cockcrow this day you will deny me three times."
He left there and wept bitterly.
The men that held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
They blindfolded him, and asked him, saying: "Prophesy: who is it that struck you?"
They reviled him and spoke many things against him.
The next day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together. They included chief priests and scribes. They led him away to their council, saying:
"If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them: "If I tell you, you will not believe:
and if I ask you, you will not answer."
"Soon the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
They all asked: "Are you the Son of God?" He said to them: "You say that I am."
They responded: "What further need do we have for witnesses? We have heard this from his mouth."
The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.
They accused him, saying: "We found this man perverting our nation. He forbids payment of tax to Caesar. He claims to be Christ a king."
Pilate asked him: "Are you King of the Jews?" He answered him: "You say it."
Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: "I find no fault in this man."
They were more insistent saying: "He excites the people throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee even to this place."
When Pilate heard it, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
When he knew that he was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod. He was in Jerusalem at that time.
Herod was very happy to see Jesus. He had wanted to see him for a long time. He hoped to see him perform a miracle.
He offered many questions but received no answers.
The chief priests and the scribes vehemently accused him.
And Herod with his soldiers despised him with contempt, and mocked him. They arrayed him in magnificent apparel. Then they sent him back to Pilate.
Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that time they were at enmity.
Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people.
He said: "You brought this man to me as one who perverted the people. I examined him before you and find no fault in this man. He has not done the things you accuse him of.
"Herod found no fault and sent him back to us. He has done nothing worthy of death.
"I will therefore punish him, and release him."
He must release one prisoner to them at the feast.
They cried out in unison: "Take this man away and release to us Barabbas!"
He was thrown into prison for insurrection sedition in the city and murder.
Pilate spoke to them again desiring to release Jesus.
But they shouted, "Impale him! Impale him!"
A third time he said to them: "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no reason to put him to death. I will therefore chastise him and release him."
But they were insistent and spoke in loud voices asking him to impale him. And they prevailed.
Pilate pronounced a sentence that what they asked for should be done.
He released the man who was in prison for insurrection and murder and he delivered Jesus to their will.
They led him away. Simon of Cyrene was traveling from the country. They seized him and forced him to carry the stake for Jesus.
A great crowd of people followed. Many women cried and grieved over him.
Jesus turned to them and said: "Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children.
"The days are coming when they will say blessed are the barren those without children and the breasts that never nursed.
"Then they will say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us.
"If they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
Two criminals were to be put to death with him.
They came to the place called the skull. They impaled him and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
The people stood watching while the rulers scoffed at him, saying: "He saved others let him save himself if this is his chosen, the Christ of God."
The soldiers mocked him and offered him vinegar,
saying: "If you are the King of the Jews save yourself."
There was a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
One of the criminals who were hanged complained bitterly to him saying: "Are you the Christ? Save yourself and us."
The other rebuked him saying: "Do you not respect God, seeing you are also condemned?
"We are indeed justly condemned for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong."
He said: "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."
He replied: "Today I tell you this. You will be with me in paradise."
It was about the sixth hour. Darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
The sun failed to shine. The veil of the temple was torn in two.
Jesus cried with a loud voice: "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit." After saying this he quit breathing.
The centurion saw what was done and glorified God, saying: "Certainly this was a righteous man."
The crowds gathered at this sight. When they saw the things that were done they left beating their breasts.
All of his friends and the women who followed him from Galilee stood watching from a distance.
Joseph was a member of the council and a good and righteous man.
He was from Arimathaea a city of the Jews and was looking for the kingdom of God.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth. Then he laid him in a tomb that was carved in stone. No man had ever lain in this tomb.
It was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was near.
The women from Galilee went with him to see the tomb and the place for the body.
They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
It was early in the morning on the first day of the week. They went to the tomb with the spices that they had prepared.
The stone was rolled away from the tomb.
When they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
They were perplexed about what had happened. Two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
This frightened them and they bowed down prostrate on the ground. The two men said to them: "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
"He is not here. He has arisen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee.
"He said the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be impaled, and the third day rise again."
They remembered his words.
When they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
They were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them. They told these things to the apostles.
These words seemed to be idle talk and they did not believe them.
Peter ran to the tomb. Looking inside he saw the linen cloths by themselves. He departed to his home, wondering about that which occurred.
That day two of them traveled to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
They talked between themselves about all the things that happened.
While they talked and discussed together Jesus came near and walked with them.
But their eyes did not permit them to recognize him.
He asked: "What are you talking about with each other as you walk?" They stopped walking and were sad.
The one named Cleopas answered him: "Do you travel alone in Jerusalem and not know the things that have happened there these days?"
He asked: "What things?" They said to him: "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene. He was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.
"The chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death. They impaled him!
"We hoped he would redeem Israel. Yes and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
"Some of the women of our company stunned us. They went to the tomb early.
"They did not find his body. They said that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
"Others with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women said. He was not there!"
He said to them: "You are foolish men. You are slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
"Did the Christ need to suffer these things and enter into his glory?"
He explained to them all the Scriptures about the things concerning him. He spoke about Moses and all the prophets.
They approached the village where they were going and he appeared to be going further.
They persuaded him not to go saying, "Abide with us. It is nearly evening and the day is almost gone." He stayed with them.
When he had sat down with them to eat he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.
Their eyes were opened and they knew him. Then he vanished out of their sight.
They said to each other: "Were our hearts not burning within us? When he spoke to us in the way and opened the scriptures to us?"
They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven gathered together with others.
"The Lord has risen indeed," they said, "and he appeared to Simon."
And they told the things that happened in the way, how they recognized him when he broke the bread.
As they spoke these things he stood in their midst and said: "May you have peace."
But they were afraid and supposed that they saw a spirit.
He said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do you question in your hearts?
"See my hands and my feet that it is I. Touch me and see. A spirit does not have flesh and bones like I have."
When he said this he showed them his hands and his feet.
While they still did not believe him but were filled with joy and wonder, he asked for something to eat.
They gave him a piece of a broiled fish.
He took it and ate it in front of them.
He said: "These are my words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you. All things must be fulfilled. They are things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me."
He opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures.
He said: "It is written that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day.
"Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
"You are witnesses of these things.
"You see I send the promise of my Father upon you. You are to wait in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."
He led them out until they were near Bethany. Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.
Filled with joy, they bowed down to him in adoration. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
They continued blessing God in the Temple.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was like God God-like.
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through him and without him not one thing was made.
He lived and his life gives light to all people.
His light shines through darkness and it cannot be extinguished.
God sent a man named John.
He came to tell witness testify about the light and help people have faith.
Not being the light he came to give a witness of it.
The true light, which gives light to every man, came into the world.
The world was made through him. He was in the world and the world did not recognize him.
He came to his own. They did not receive him!
He gave the right to become children of God to all who received him. Even to those who believe in his name.
They were born from God. It was not from blood, or the will of the flesh, or the will of man.
The Word Jesus became flesh a human being and lived with us. We saw the glory of the only begotten son from the Father. He was full of loving-kindness and truth.
John spoke about him and declared: He is the one I said would come after me. He is greater than I am because he lived before me."
Out of the fullness of his undeserved kindness he gives us one blessing after another.
The law came through Moses. Loving-kindness and truth came through Jesus Christ.
No man has ever seen God. The only begotten God-like one who is closest to the Father in the bosom of the Father tells us about him.
John gave his witness even as Jewish authorities sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked him: "Who are you?"
He said: "I am not the Christ."
They asked him: "Are you Elijah?" He said: "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered: "No."
They said to him: "Who are you? We need to know so we can tell the ones who sent us."
He said: "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Isaiah the prophet said: ‘ Make straight the way of Jehovah. ’"
They were sent from the Pharisees.
They said to him: "Why do you baptize if you are not the Christ, not Elijah, and not the prophet?"
John answered: "I baptize in water. There is one in your midst whom you do not know.
"I am not worthy to fasten his shoes."
These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
The next day he saw Jesus coming to him. He boldly declared: "Behold! The Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!"
"This is he whom I said would come after me. He is greater than I am because he came before me.
"I did not know him. I came baptizing in water so that everyone in Israel will come to know him."
John said: "I saw the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven upon him.
"I did not know he was the one. God sent me to baptize in water and said: ‘ You will see one upon whom the spirit descends. The same is he who baptizes in Holy Spirit. ’
"I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."
The next day John was standing with two of his disciples.
He looked at Jesus as he walked, and said: "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus.
Jesus turned and saw them following. He asked them, "What are you after? They asked him: "Teacher, where are you staying?"
He said" "Come and see." So they came to where he was staying. They stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
One of the two, who heard John speak and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
He found his brother Simon first. He said to him: "We have found the Messiah Christ."
He took him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said: "You are Simon the son of John: you will be called Cephas meaning: Peter."
The next day he was reminded to go into Galilee. There he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip found Nathanael, and said to him: "We have found the person Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Law and God’s word. It is Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
And Nathanael said to him: "Could any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip said: "Come and see."
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said: "Look an Israelite indeed. There is no deceit in him!"
Nathanael asked: "How do you know me?" Jesus answered: "I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you."
Nathanael answered: "Rabbi you are the Son of God. You are King of Israel."
Jesus responded: "I told you I saw you under the fig tree. Is this why you believe? You will see greater things than these."
Jesus continued: "You will see the heavens opened and you will see the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee on the third day. The mother of Jesus was there.
Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.
They ran out of wine. So the mother of Jesus said to him: "They have no wine."
Jesus said to her: "Woman what have I to do with you? My hour has not arrived."
His mother told the servants to do whatever he says.
Six stone water jars were placed there to honor purification rules of the Jews. Each contained more than twenty gallons.
Jesus said to them: "Fill the jars with water." They filled them to the brim.
"Draw some out," he said, "and take it to the master of the feast." So they drew some out.
The master of the feast did not know about the water turned into wine. He tasted it and called the bridegroom.
He said to him: "Every man sets out the good wine first. When the men have drunk freely the lower quality wine is served. You have kept the good wine until now."
This was the first miracle Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. It gave evidence of his glory and his disciples believed in him.
He, his mother, brothers and disciples traveled to Capernaum. They stayed there many days.
The Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went to Jerusalem.
He found the merchants who sold oxen, sheep and doves. The moneychangers were sitting nearby.
He made a whip of cords, and chased them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the oxen. He poured out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned the tables.
He told those who sold doves: "Take these things away. Do not make my Father’s house a house of merchandise."
His disciples remembered what was written. ‘ Zeal for your house shall eat me up. ’
The Jews asked him: "What sign would you show us seeing that you do these things?
Jesus replied: "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up."
The Jews responded: "It took forty-six years to build this temple and you will raise it up in three days?"
But he spoke of the temple of his body.
When he was raised from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus said.
When he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many saw the signs he did and expressed active faith in his name.
Jesus did not trust his security to them for he understood all men.
He did not need evidence about men for he knew what was in man.
Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
He came to Jesus by night, and said to him: "Rabbi! We know you are a teacher from God. No one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."
Jesus answered: "Truly I tell you unless a person is born again brought forth from above he cannot see the kingdom of God."
Nicodemus asked: "How could a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother’s womb again and be born?"
Jesus responded: "I tell you truth, except a man be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!
"That which is born from the flesh is flesh and that which is born from the Spirit is spirit.
"Do not marvel that I say you must be born again.
"The wind blows where it will. You hear the sound of it. Yet you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. It is like this with every one who is born from the Spirit."
Nicodemus asked: "How can these things be?"
Jesus answered: "Are you a teacher of Israel and you do not understand these things?
"This is the truth. We speak what we know and witness about what we have seen. But you do not receive our testimony.
"If I told you earthly things and you did not have faith, how will you have faith if I tell you heavenly things?
"No one has ever ascended into heaven but the Son of man who descended from heaven.
"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must also be lifted up.
"Everyone who has an active faith in him may have everlasting life.
"For God loved the world so much, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever has an active faith in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
"God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world. Instead the world should be saved through him.
"He who has an active faith in him is not judged. He who does not have an active faith has been judged already for he has not had faith in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
"This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world. People loved the darkness rather than the light for their works were evil.
"Every one who does evil hates the light. He does not come to the light because his works would be reproved.
"He who practices the truth comes to the light. His works are made known that they are from God."
After these things Jesus and his disciples traveled to the land of Judea where he stayed with them and baptized.
John was also baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there. People came and were baptized.
John had not yet been thrown into prison.
There was a controversy between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purification.
They went to John and said: "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, the one about whom you witnessed, he and the men with him baptize."
John answered: "A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven.
"You bear witness that I said I am not the Christ. I have been sent before him.
"He that has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens to him. He rejoices greatly because he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This fills me with joy.
"He must increase and I must decrease."
"He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from an earthly viewpoint. He who comes from heaven is superior.
"He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no man accepts his testimony.
"He who receives his testimony confirms by his seal that God is true.
"For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God. God does not give the spirit by measure.
"The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
"He who puts active faith in the Son has everlasting life. He who disobeys the Son will not see life for the wrath of God remains upon him." Greek: apeitheo: willfully disobey, not having faith
The Lord was aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John.
Actually Jesus did not baptize. His disciples baptized.
He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
He needed to travel through Samaria.
He arrived at a city of Samaria called Sychar. It is near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
Jacob’s well was there. It was about the sixth hour when Jesus arrived. Being weary from the journey he sat down by the well.
A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: "Please give me a drink."
His disciples went away to the city to buy meat.
The woman of Samaria asked: "How is it that you being a Jew ask for a drink from me? I am a woman of Samaria." The Jews did not associate with Samaritans. Not in early manuscripts.
Jesus answered: "If you know the gift of God and who asked you for a drink, you would have asked him to give you living water."
The woman said to him: "Sir, you do not have anything with which to draw water and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?
"Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well. He and his children and cattle drank from it."
Jesus answered: "Whoever drinks from this water will thirst again.
"But whoever drinks from the water that I give him will never thirst. The water that I will give him will be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
The woman said to him: "Sir, give me this water! That way I will not thirst and not come here to draw."
Jesus said to her: "Go call your husband and come here."
The woman answered: "I have no husband." Jesus replied to her: "You said well, "I have no husband."
"For you have had five husbands. The one you have now is not your husband, this is true."
The woman said to him: "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain. But you say Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
Jesus replied: "Woman believe me. The hour comes when you will worship the Father neither in the mountain nor in Jerusalem.
"You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know. Salvation is from the Jews.
"But the hour comes and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father with spirit and truth. The Father seeks such people to worship him.
"God is a Spirit. They who worship him must worship him with spirit and truth."
The woman responded: "I know that Christ the Messiah is coming. When he comes he will tell us all things."
Jesus said: "I that speak to you am he."
His disciples came and wondered why he talked with the woman. Yet no one asked: "What are you looking for? Why did you talk to her?"
The woman left her water pot and went to the city. She spoke to the men.
"Come see a man who told me everything I have ever done. Could this be the Christ?"
They left the city to see him.
In the meantime his disciples urged him to eat.
He said: "I have food to eat that you do not know about."
So the disciples said to each other: "Has any man brought him something to eat?"
Jesus said: "My food is to do the will of him that sent me. To finish his work!
"Do you say there are four months until the harvest comes? I say to you lift up your eyes and look on the fields. They are already white for harvest.
"He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal. Both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
"That saying is true. One sows and another reaps.
"I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Other men labored and you entered into their labors."
Many Samaritans of that city put faith believed in him because of what the woman said: "He told me everything I have ever done."
When the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with them. So he stayed there two days.
Many more believed because of the words he spoke.
They told the woman: "We believe because of what you said and we heard him ourselves. We know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world!"
After two days he departed from there and went to Galilee.
Jesus testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
The Galileans welcomed him. They saw all the things he did at the feast in Jerusalem for they were at the feast.
Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee where he turned the water into wine. There was a nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
He heard that Jesus came from Judea into Galilee. He went to him and urged him to come see his son. His son was near death.
"Until you see signs and wonders you will not believe," Jesus said.
The nobleman said: "Sir, come or my child would die."
Jesus replied: "Go your way. Your son lives!" The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.
His servants met him as he returned and said: "Your son is alive!"
He asked them about the hour he was healed. They said: "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
The father knew that it was the same hour in which Jesus said: "Your son lives." He and his entire household believed.
This is the second miracle that Jesus did when he came out of Judea into Galilee.
After this the Jews had a Festival holy day, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
There is a pool by the sheep-market gate at Jerusalem. It is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethzatha. It has five porches colonnades.
In these lay a great crowd of sick people, of blind and lame waiting for the water to bubble up.
A man who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years was present.
Jesus saw him lying there. He knew that he had been sick for a long time. So he asked him: "Do you want to get well?"
The sick man replied: "I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is stirred. Others step down before I can go."
Jesus said: "Arise pick up your bed and walk."
Immediately the man was made whole. He picked up his bed and walked. It happened on the Sabbath day.
So the Jews told the man who was cured: "It is not lawful for you to pickup your bed for it is the Sabbath."
He answered: "He who made me whole told me to pick up my bed and walk."
"Who is the man," they asked, "that said to you pick up your bed and walk?"
He did not know who healed him for Jesus quietly left the crowd.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and told him: "Now that you are healed do not sin anymore and avoid worse things happening to you."
The man went away and told the Jews Jesus made him whole.
The Jews persecuted Jesus because he did these things on the Sabbath.
Jesus responded to them: "My Father works until now and I work."
The Jews intensified their efforts to kill him for these reasons: he broke the Sabbath and he also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
Jesus answered them: "Truly I tell you the Son can do nothing by himself. He sees the Father do something and then he does it. Whatever the Father does the Son does in like manner.
"The Father loves the Son. He shows him all of the things he does. He will show him greater works than these. And you will marvel.
"The Father raises the dead and gives them life. The Son also gives life to those he wills.
"The Father does not judge any man for he has given all judgment to the Son.
"All may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father that sent him.
"Truly, Truly I say to you, he who hears my word, and believes him that sent me, has everlasting life. He will not receive judgment for he has passed out of death into life.
"Truly I tell you, the hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear listen understand will live.
"The Son has life in himself just as the Father has life in himself. For the Father gave him life.
"And he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.
"Do not wonder about this for the hour is coming when everyone in the grave will hear his voice.
"They will return. Those who did good will have the resurrection of life. Those who did evil will receive the resurrection of judgment.
"I can do nothing by myself. So I hear and judge and my judgment is righteous. I do not seek my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
"If I alone testify about myself, my testimony is not enough truth.
"There is another who testifies about me. I know that his evidence about me is true.
"You sent people to John the Baptist and he has witnessed about the truth.
"The testimony I receive is not from man. However I say these things that you may be saved.
"He was the lamp that burns and shines. You were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.
"The testimony I have is greater than that of John. The works I do are the works the Father gave me to accomplish. They testify that the Father has sent me.
"The Father who sent me testifies about me. You have not heard his voice nor seen him at any time.
"You do not have his word dwelling in you. This is because you do not believe in the person he has sent.
"You search investigate study the Scriptures because you think that in them you have everlasting life. These Scriptures testify about me.
"And yet you will not come to me that you may have life.
"I do not accept glory from men.
"I know that the love of God is not in you.
"I came in my Father’s name and you did not receive me. If another came in his own name you would receive him.
"How can you believe? You seek praise and glory from one another? Why do you not seek the glory that comes from the only God?
"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Moses on whom you have set your hope is a plaintiff against you.
"It is a fact! If you believed Moses you would believe me. He wrote about me!
"If you do not believe his writings how will you believe my words?"
After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
A great crowd followed him because they saw the signs miracles he performed on the sick.
Jesus and his disciples went to the mountain.
It was time for the Passover feast of the Jews.
Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him. He asked Philip: "Where will we buy enough bread to feed them?"
He said this to test him for he knew what he would do.
Philip answered: "Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for everyone to take a little."
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, one of his disciples said:
"There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish. What are these among so many?"
Jesus said: "Make the people sit down." There were about five thousand men who sat down on the grass.
Jesus gave thanks and then he distributed the loaves along with the fish to those sitting on the grass.
When they were filled he told the disciples to gather up the broken pieces left over so nothing would be wasted.
They gathered twelve baskets of leftovers after everyone had eaten.
When the people saw the miracle performed they said: "Truly this is the prophet who came into the world."
Jesus knew that they were about to take him by force and make him king. So he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
That evening his disciples went to the sea.
They boarded a boat to travel over the sea to Capernaum. It was dark and Jesus had not yet come to them.
A great wind made the sea rise.
They rowed about four miles and saw Jesus walking on the sea. He came close to the boat. They were afraid.
He said to them: "It is I. Do not be afraid!"
They eagerly brought him into the boat. The boat soon arrived at the land where they were going.
The next day the crowd stood by the side of the sea. Jesus entered the only boat while his disciples went away alone.
Small boats from Tiberias came there to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks.
When the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there they got into the boats and traveled to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
They found him on the other side of the sea and said: "Rabbi Teacher when did you come here?"
Jesus said: "Truly I tell you, you seek me not because you saw miracles but because you ate of the loaves and were full.
"Do not work for food that perishes but for food that offers everlasting life. The Son of man will give you this food. The Father, even God, has set his seal upon him."
They asked: "What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"
Jesus answered: "This is the work of God, that you have an active faith in the one whom he has sent."
They asked: "What do you offer for a sign miracle that we may see and believe you? What work will you do?
"Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness. It is written, ‘ He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. ’"
Jesus responded: "I speak the truth! It was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven. My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
"For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven. It gives life to the world."
They responded: "Lord, always give us this bread."
Jesus replied: "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not hunger. The one who puts active faith in me will never thirst.
"I told you. You have seen me and yet do not believe.
"That which the Father gives me will come to me. I will not reject him who comes to me.
"I do not do my own will. I came down from heaven to do the will of him that sent me.
"This is the will of him that sent me that I should not lose any of those he has given me, but I should raise them up at the last day.
"For this is the will of my Father. Every one who sees the Son and puts active faith in him will have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day."
The Jews complained about him. This is because he said ‘ I am the bread that came down out of heaven. ’
They said: "Is Jesus the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How does he now say, I came down out of heaven?"
Jesus answered: "Stop complaining and saying things against me.
"No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him. I will resurrect him raise him up in the last day.
"It is written in the prophets: Jehovah shall teach them all. Every one who hears the Father and has learned comes to me.
"No one has seen the Father. Only he who is from God, He has seen the Father.
"Truly, truly I tell you, he who believes has everlasting life.
"I am the bread of life.
"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.
"This is the bread that comes down out of heaven that a man may eat of it and not die.
"I am the living bread that came down out of heaven. If any man eats of this bread he will live forever. Yes and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."
The Jews argued with one another saying: "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
Jesus responded to them: "Truly I tell you if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood you will not have life in yourselves.
"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life! I will raise him up at the last day.
"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides with me, and I with him.
"The living Father sent me and I live because of the Father. He who takes me for his food will live because of me.
"This is the bread that came down out of heaven. It is not like the bread manna the fathers ate and then died. He who eats this bread will live forever."
He said these things in the synagogue when he taught in Capernaum.
When they heard this many of his disciples said: "This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?"
He knew his disciples complained about this. Jesus said: "Does this cause you to stumble?
"What if you see the Son of man ascending where he was before?
"It is the spirit that gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I spoke to you are spirit and life.
"There are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning whom they were who did not believe and who would betray him.
He stated: "For this reason listen to what I say. No man can come to me, except it be given to him from the Father."
After this many of his disciples returned to their old ways. They did not walk with him anymore.
Jesus asked the twelve: "Will you also go away?"
Simon Peter answered him: "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life!
"We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."
Jesus replied: "Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil false accuser slanderer demon".
He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot one of the twelve, for he would betray him.
After that Jesus walked in Galilee. He would not walk in Judea because the Jews looked for ways to kill him.
It was time for the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles.
His brothers said to him: "Leave here and go to Judea. That way your disciples also may see the works that you do.
"No one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world."
For his brothers did not express active faith in him.
Then Jesus replied: "My time is not yet here but your time is always ready.
"The world has no reason to hate you. But it hates me because I testify that its works are evil.
"You go to this feast. I will not go to this feast for my time has not yet come."
When he said these words to them he stayed in Galilee.
When his brothers left he secretly went to the feast.
The Jews looked for him at the feast and they said: "Where is he?"
There was much whispering among the people concerning him. Some said: "He is a good man." Others said: "No, he deceives the people."
However no man spoke openly about him out of fear of the Jews.
Midway through the feast Jesus went to the temple and taught.
The Jews wondered saying: "How does this man know letters? He has had no formal education."
Jesus replied: "My teaching is not my own. It is his who sent me.
"If any man does his will he shall know the teachings. He will know if it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.
"He who speaks from his own authority seeks his own glory. He who seeks glory for the one who sent him is true. Unrighteousness is not found in him.
"Did Moses give you the law? Yet none of you obey the law! Why do you seek to kill me?"
The crowd answered: "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"
Jesus responded: "I did one work and you all marveled because of it.
"Moses gave you circumcision. Not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers. And you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
"A man receives circumcision on the Sabbath. That way the Law of Moses may not be broken. Are you angry with me, because I made an entire man whole on the Sabbath?
"Do not judge according to appearance! Judge a righteous judgment."
Some in Jerusalem asked: "Is this he whom they seek to kill?
"He spoke openly and they said nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?
"How is it we know where this man is from but when the Christ comes no one will know where he is from?"
Jesus shouted in the temple: "You know me and from where I came. I did not come on my own. He who sent me is true and you do not know him.
"I know him because I am from him and he sent me."
They looked for a way to capture him. But no man laid his hand on him. This is because his hour had not yet arrived.
Many in the crowd believed in him. They asked: "When the Christ comes will he do more signs than those this man has done?"
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things concerning him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to capture him.
Jesus therefore said: "I am with you a little while. Then I go to him who sent me.
"You will seek me and will not find me. You cannot come where I am going."
The Jews said among themselves: "Where will this man go that we shall not find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
"What is this word that he said: ‘ You will seek me, and will not find me; and you cannot come where I am going? ’"
On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and shouted in a loud voice: "If any man thirst let him come to me and drink.
"Rivers of living water will flow from the innermost being of the man who believes in me. This is according to the scriptures."
He spoke this by the Spirit. Those who believed in him were to receive the Spirit. The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.
When they heard these words some of the crowd proclaimed: "This truly is the prophet!
Others said: "This is the Christ." But some asked: "Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
"Do the Scriptures say that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"
So there arose a division in the crowd because of him.
Some of them wanted to apprehend him. Yet no man laid hands on him.
The chief priests and Pharisees asked the officers: "Why did you not bring him?"
"No man has ever spoken the way he speaks," they replied.
The Pharisees therefore answered them: "Are you also deceived?
"Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?
"This crowd does not know the law. It is contemptible"
Nicodemus spoke to them. He is the Pharisee who earlier went to Jesus.
"Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to find out what he has done?"
They replied: "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet comes out of Galilee."
Again Jesus spoke to them, saying: "I am the light of the world. He that follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."
The Pharisees therefore replied to him: "You testify about yourself. Your evidence is not true!"
Jesus answered them: "Even if I bear witness about myself, my testimony is true! I know where I came from and I know where I am going. You do not know where I came from or where I am going.
"You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.
"Yes and if I judge my judgment is true. I am not alone for I am with the Father who sent me.
"It is written in your law that the witness of two men is true.
"I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me."
They said: "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered: "You do not know me, nor do you know my Father! If you knew me you would also know my Father."
He spoke these words at the treasury as he taught in the temple. No one tried to arrest him because his hour had not yet arrived.
He said: "I go away. You will seek me and will die in your sin. You cannot come where I go."
The Jews asked: "Would he kill himself? For he said you could not come where I go."
He responded to them: "You are from below. I am from above. You are from this world. I am not from this world.
"I said to you that you would die in your sins. Unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins!"
"Who are you," they asked. Jesus replied: "What have I been telling you from the beginning?
"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. He that sent me is true. I tell the world the things he told me."
They were not aware that he spoke to them about the Father.
Jesus said: "When you have lifted up impaled the Son of man you will know that I am that person. I do nothing by myself! I speak what the Father taught me!
"He sent me and is with me. He has not left me alone. I always do the things that are pleasing to him!"
Many believed when he said these things.
Jesus told the Jews who believed him: "If you dwell in my word you truly are my disciples.
"You will know the truth and the truth will make you free!"
They answered him: "We are Abraham’s seed, and have never been in bondage to any man. How can you say we will be made free?"
Jesus answered: "Truly I tell you every one who commits sin is a slave of sin.
"The slave does not abide in the house forever. The son abides forever.
"If therefore the Son will make you free, you will be free indeed.
"I know that you are Abraham’s seed. Yet you seek to kill me. That is because my word has no place among you.
"I speak the things that I have seen and heard when I was with my Father. You also do the things that you heard from your father."
They answered: "Our father is Abraham." Jesus replied: "If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.
"You seek to kill me. I told you the truth! I heard it from God. Abraham did not do this.
"You do the works of your father." They said: "We were not born of fornication. We have one Father, God!"
Jesus said: "If God were your Father you would love me. I came from God! I have not come from myself. He sent me!
"Why do you not understand what I say? Can you not hear me?
"You are from your father Satan the Devil slanderer false accuser! You want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning. He does not stand for the truth. There is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks his own lies. He is a liar and the father of the lie!
"I tell you the truth and you do not believe me.
"Which of you convicted me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe me?
"He that is of God hears the words of God. That is why you do not listen. You are not from God!"
The Jews answered: "Do we not speak correctly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"
Jesus answered: "I have no demon. I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
"I do not seek my own glory. There is one that seeks and judges.
"Truly I tell you if a man obeys my word he will never see death."
The Jews said to him: "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died. And you say if a man obeys my word he will never taste of death.
"Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died! The prophets also died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"
Jesus answered: "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. My Father glorifies me. He is the one whom you say is your God.
"You do not know him. I know him. If I say I do not know him I would be like you, a liar! But I know him and obey his word.
"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it and was glad."
The Jews replied: "You are not yet fifty years old. Have you seen Abraham?"
Jesus said: "I tell you the truth, I existed before Abraham was born!"
They took up stones to throw at him. But Jesus hid himself and left the temple.
He saw a man who was blind from birth.
His disciples asked him: "Rabbi he was born blind. Who sinned, this man or his parents?"
Jesus answered: "This man did not sin. Neither did his parents sin. The works of God should be made known in him.
"We must work the works of him that sent me while it is day. When the night comes no man can work.
"When I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle. Then he anointed the eyes of the blind with the clay.
He told him: "Go wash in the pool of Siloam." He went there and washed. And he could see!
The neighbors saw him afterwards. They knew he was a blind beggar. So they asked: Is this he who sat and begged?
Others said: "It is he." Yet others said: "No, but he is like him." He said: "I am he!"
How were your eyes opened? They asked.
He answered: "The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. I went there and washed, and I received sight."
They inquired asked: "Where is he?" He responded: "I do not know."
They brought the former blind man to the Pharisees.
Jesus healed the blind man on the Sabbath day.
The Pharisees asked him how he received his sight. He said to them:" He put clay on my eyes, I washed and now I see."
Some of the Pharisees said: "This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said: "How could a man that is a sinner perform such signs?" There was division among them.
They spoke again to the former blind man. "What do you say about him?" He said: "He is a prophet."
The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and then received his sight. So they called his parents.
They asked the parents: "Is this your son? Was he born blind? How does he see now?"
His parents answered: "This is our son and he was born blind.
"We do not know how he now sees or who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and he will speak for himself."
The parents said these things because they feared the Jews. The Jews had agreed that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
So the parents said: "Ask him, he is of age."
So they called the man that was blind a second time, and said to him: "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."
He answered: "I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I know, I was blind and now I see."
They asked: "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?
He answered them: "I told you before and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Would you also become his disciples?"
Then they spoke abusively to him: "You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses."
We know that God spoke to Moses. As for this man we do not know where he is from.
The man answered: "This certainly is a marvel that you do not know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes."
"We know that God does not listen to sinners. If any man respects God and does his will, God listens to him.
"Since the world began no one ever heard of a man opening the eyes of someone born blind.
"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
They answered: "You were born in sin and you teach us?" Then they threw him out.
Jesus heard that they threw him out. He found him and said: "Do you believe in the Son of God?"
He answered: "Who is he Lord that I may believe in him?"
Jesus replied: "You both see and hear him for he speaks with you."
"Lord I believe," he said. And he bowed down to him.
Jesus said: "I came into the world for this judgment that those not seeing may see and those seeing may become blind."
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him: "Are we also blind?"
Jesus replied: "If you were blind you would have no sin. But you say we see so your sin remains."
"Truly I tell you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs up some other way is a thief and a robber.
"He who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
"The doorkeeper opens to him and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his sheep by name and leads them.
"When all of his own are out he leads them. The sheep follow him for they know his voice.
"They will not follow a stranger but will flee from him. They do not know the voice of a stranger."
They did not understand this illustration Jesus spoke to them.
Jesus explained: "I am the door of the sheep.
"Thieves and robbers came in place of me but the sheep did not listen to them.
"I am the door. If any man enters through me he will be saved. He will go in and out and find pasture.
"The thief comes to steal, and kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
"The hired man owns no sheep. He is not the shepherd. He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep. The wolf snatches them, and scatters them.
"He leaves because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.
"I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me.
Just as the Father knows me I know the Father! I lay down my life for the sheep.
"I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I will also bring them. They will hear my voice and they will become one flock, one shepherd.
"The Father loves me. Therefore I lay down my life and I take it back again.
"No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down voluntarily. I have authority jurisdiction right to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from my Father."
The Jews were again divided because of what Jesus said.
Many of them said: "He has a demon and is mad. Why listen to him?"
Others said: "These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
It was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem.
It was wintertime. Jesus was walking in the temple on Solomon’s porch the Colonnade of Solomon.
The Jews came to him and asked: "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
Jesus replied: "I told you and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness of me.
"You do not believe because you are not my sheep!
"My sheep hear my voice. I know them and they follow me.
"I give them eternal life. They will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.
"My Father has given them to me. He is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.
"The Father and I are one united in purpose."
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
Jesus replied to them: "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works do you stone me?"
The Jews answered him: "We do not stone you for good work but for blasphemy. You are a man and you make yourself like God."
Jesus said: "Is it not written in your law, I said, you are ‘ god-like ones’?
"So if he called them ‘ god-like ones, ’ ’ those to whom the word of God came, and the Scriptures may not be annulled,
"do you say to the one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, you blaspheme? And this because I said, I am the Son of God.
"If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
"But if I do them and you do not believe me, believe the works! That way you may know and understand that the Father is with me, and I am with the Father."
They tried again to capture him but he escaped from them.
He traveled beyond the Jordan into the place where John first baptized and stayed there.
Many came to him and they said: "John indeed did not perform a single miracle. Yet everything John said about this man was true."
Many believed in him there.
A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived at Bethany where his sisters Mary and Martha lived.
This is the same Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.
The sisters therefore sent for the Lord, They said: "The one for whom you have great affection is sick."
When Jesus heard it he said: "This sickness will not end in death. It is for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it."
Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
When he heard the news he stayed where he was for two days.
After this he said to the disciples: "Let us go to Judea again."
The disciples said: "Rabbi, the Jews were seeking to stone you and you go there?"
Jesus answered: "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.
"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
Then he told them: "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. I go to wake him out of sleep."
The disciples said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he would recover."
Jesus spoke of his death. They thought he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
Then Jesus said plainly: "Lazarus is dead!"
"I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, for it will help you believe. Let us go to him."
Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: "Let us also go that we may die with him."
When Jesus arrived he found Lazarus had been in the grave four days.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.
Many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to console them about their brother.
Martha went out to meet Jesus and Mary sat in the house.
Martha said to Jesus: "Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died.
"Even now I know that what ever you ask of God he will give it to you."
Jesus replied: "Your brother will rise again."
Martha exclaimed: "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
Jesus said: "I am the resurrection and the life. He who puts active faith in me will live, even if he dies.
"Whoever lives and puts active faith in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
She said: "Yes Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who is to come into the world."
After she said this she went away and secretly called her sister Mary. She said: "The teacher is here and calls you."
Mary got up quickly and went to him.
The Jews were with her in the house, consoling her. They saw Mary get up quickly and leave. So they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
When Mary saw Jesus she fell down at his feet. She said: "Lord; if you had been here my brother would not have died."
Jesus groaned in his spirit and was troubled when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping.
He asked: "Where have you laid him?" They answered: "Come and see Lord."
Jesus wept.
The Jews therefore said: "Look how deeply he loved him!"
Some of them said: "This man opened the eyes of the blind. Could he have prevented this man from dying?"
Again Jesus groaned in himself. He went to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid against it.
Jesus said: "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the dead man said: "Lord by now the body has decayed for he has been dead four days."
Jesus said to her: "Did I not say that if you believe you shall see the glory of God?"
So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said: "Father, I thank you that you hear me.
"I knew that you always hear me. But because of the crowd that stands here I said it, that they may believe that you did send me."
After he finished he cried out loud: "Lazarus, come out!"
He that was dead came out. He was bound hand and foot with grave-clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus commanded them: "Unwrap him and let him go."
Many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what he did, believed in him.
Some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.
The chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council. They asked what they should do. "This man does many signs and miracles.
"If we let him alone all men will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
Caiaphas the high priest that year said to them: "You know nothing at all.
"You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people. That way the whole nation will not perish."
He did not say this from his own understanding. As high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.
He would die for the nation. He would also gather together the children of God that are scattered abroad.
So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.
Jesus did not walk openly among the Jews anymore. He departed into the wilderness of the nearby country. He and his disciples stayed at a city called Ephraim.
It was the Jewish Passover. Many went out of the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover.
They searched for Jesus. They stood in the temple speaking to one another: "What do you think? Will he come to the feast?"
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that, if any man knew where he was, he should report it that they might seize him.
Six days before the Passover Jesus traveled to Bethany. This was where Lazarus lived. He was the man Jesus raised from the dead.
Jesus ate supper there. He and Lazarus sat at the meal while Martha served.
Mary took a pound of very precious ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would betray him said:
"Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred danarii, and given to the poor?"
He did not say this because he cared for the poor. He was a thief. He had the moneybox and took away what was put in it.
Jesus therefore replied: "Let her alone that she may preserve it for the day of my burial.
"You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me."
The common people of the Jews learned that he was there. So they came to see Jesus and Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead.
The chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death.
This is because by reason of Lazarus many of the Jews believed in Jesus.
The next day a great crowd came to the feast. They heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
They took palm branches and met him. They cried out, "Hosanna: Blessed is he who comes in the name of Jehovah, even the King of Israel!"
Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it just as it is written:
"Do not fear daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes sitting on a donkey’s colt."
His disciples did not understand these things at first. However when Jesus was glorified they remembered the things that were written about him. They also remembered the things that had been done to him.
The crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, gave witness.
For this reason also the crowd met him, for they heard that he had performed this miracle.
The Pharisees spoke among themselves: "You see that you are not accomplishing anything. Look the world has gone after him."
Now there were Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.
They approached Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and told him: "We wish to see Jesus."
Philip and Andrew told Jesus.
Jesus answered: "The time has come for the Son of man to be glorified.
"Truly I tell you unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies it bears much fruit.
"He that loves his life in this world loses it; and he that detests does not love his life in this world shall save it for everlasting life.
"If you want to serve me follow me! My servant will be where I am and the Father will honor my servant.
"I am troubled! What should I say? Father, save me out of this hour? It is for this purpose that I came to this hour!
"Father, glorify your name." A voice came from heaven: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
The crowd near him only heard thunder. Some said an angel spoke to him.
Jesus said: "This voice came for your sake and not for mine.
"Now judgment is on this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
"When I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all men to myself."
He said this indicating the type of death he would experience.
The crowd answered him: "We have heard from the law that the Christ lives forever. Why do you say the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?"
Jesus said to them: "The light will be with you for a little while. Walk while you have the light, that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.
"While you have the light, exert active faith in the light, that you may become sons of light." Jesus said this and then he departed and hid himself from them.
Even though he performed many miracles in front of them they did not believe in him.
The word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled: "Jehovah who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?"
Isaiah revealed the reason they could not believe:
"He has blinded their eyes. He hardened their heart. Otherwise they would see with their eyes and perceive with their heart. Then they would turn and I would heal them."
Isaiah said these things because he saw and spoke about his glory.
Many of the rulers believed in him, although they did not confess their faith because of the Pharisees, for they would be expelled from the synagogue.
They loved the glory from men more than the glory from God.
Jesus cried out: "He, who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.
"He that sees me sees perceives discerns experiences the one who sent me.
"I have come as a light to the world. Everyone who believes in me will not remain in darkness.
"If any man hears my sayings and does not obey them I will not judge him. I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
"He that rejects me and does not accept my message has one that judges him. The word divine expression God’s Word that I spoke shall judge him now and in the last day.
"I spoke not from myself but from the Father who sent me. He has given me a commandment concerning what I should say when I speak.
"I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore I say the things the Father tells me to say."
Jesus knew before the feast of the Passover that the time had come for him to leave this world and return to his Father. He loved his own who were in the world to the very end.
The devil influenced the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son. So he betrayed him during the meal.
Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over all things. He also knew it came from God and he returns it to God.
He got up from the meal and laid aside his garments. He wrapped a towel around his waist.
Then he poured water into the basin and washed the disciples’ feet. He wiped them with the towel he was wearing.
When he approached, Simon Peter said: "Lord do you wash my feet?"
"You do not know what I do now," Jesus said: "but you will understand later."
Peter said: "You will never wash my feet." Jesus answered him: "If I do not wash you; you have no part with me."
Simon Peter replied: "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."
Jesus responded: "He that is bathed must wash his feet. He is clean everywhere and you are clean, but not all."
He knew who would betray him. That is why he said you are not all clean.
After he washed their feet he put his outer garments on and sat down. He asked: "Do you know what I have done to you?
"You call me Teacher and Lord and you are right for I am.
"If the Teacher and Lord washed your feet you should wash one another’s feet.
"I have given you an example. You should also do as I have done to you.
"Truly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his master. Neither is one that is sent greater than he that sent him.
"If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
"I do not speak about all of you. I know whom I have chosen! This way the scripture may be fulfilled: ‘ He that eats my bread lifted up his heel against me. ’"
"I tell you before it happens. So that when it takes place you may believe that I am he.
"Truly I say to you, he who receives whom ever I send receives me. And he who receives me receives him who sent me.
After Jesus said this he was troubled in spirit and said: One of you will betray me."
The disciples looked at each other. They were perplexed and wondered who it would be.
The disciple whom Jesus loved was leaning on his chest.
Simon Peter motioned to him: "Ask him who it is," he urged.
He leaned back on Jesus’ breast and said to him: "Lord, who is it?"
Jesus answered: "It is he to whom I give a piece of bread after I dip it." So when he dipped the bread he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
After he was given the piece of bread Satan entered him. Jesus said to him: "Do what you do quickly."
No man at the table knew for what purpose he spoke this to him.
Some thought Judas was going to shop for food for the feast or give something to the poor. Judas was in charge of the moneybox.
He received the morsel of bread and left immediately. It was night.
When he was gone Jesus said: "Now the Son of man is glorified praised exulted proclaimed honored and God is glorified through him.
"If God is glorified through him, God will also immediately glorify him.
"Little children I am with you for a little while. You will seek me and as I told the Jews now I say to you, where I go, you cannot come.
"I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.
"All men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another."
Simon Peter said: "Lord where are you going?" Jesus answered: "Where I am going you cannot follow me now. You will follow me later."
Peter said: "Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
Jesus answered: "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly I tell you the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times."
"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me.
"In my Father’s house are many dwelling places. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
"If I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and I will receive you to myself, for where I am you may also be.
"You know where I go and you know the way."
Thomas said to him: "Lord, we do not know where you go. How do we know the way?"
Jesus proclaimed: "I am the way, the truth, and the life! No one comes to the Father except through me.
"If you had known me, you would have perceived my Father also. From now on you understand him and have experienced him."
Philip said: "Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us."
Jesus responded: "Have I been with you so long a time and you do not know me Philip? He who has seen me has discerned experienced perceived the Father. And you say, show us the Father?
"Do you not believe that I am with the Father and that the Father is with me? The words I say to you are not from me, but the Father dwells with me and does his works.
"Believe me that I am with the Father and the Father is with me, or else believe me because of the works.
"Truly I tell you, he who exerts active faith in me will do the works that I do. In fact he will do greater works than these. I go to the Father.
"Whatever you ask in my name, I will do. That way the Father may be glorified because of the Son.
"If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
"If you love me, you will keep obey my commandments!
"I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another helper, that he the Father may be with you forever.
"It is the Spirit of the truth. The world cannot receive it. The world does not see or know it. You know it because it lives with you and will be with you.
"I will not leave you desolate. I will come to you.
"A little while and the world will not see me anymore, but you will. I live and you will also live.
"In that day you will know that I am with my Father, and you with me, and I with you.
"He that has my commandments, and obeys them loves me. My Father will love the person who loves me. I will love him and disclose myself to him."
Judas not Iscariot asked him: "Lord, what will happen that you will disclose yourself to us, and not to the world?"
Jesus answered: "If a man loves me, he will obey my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and dwell with him.
"He who does not love me does not obey my words. The word you hear is not mine, but comes from the Father who sent me.
"I speak these things while being present with you.
"The Father will send a helper in my name, the Holy Spirit, which Greek: hos he ho which that one will teach you all things and bring to your memory all that I said to you.
"Peace I leave with you! My peace I give to you. I do not give as the world gives to you. Do not let your heart be troubled or full of fear.
"You heard me say I will go away and I will come again to you. If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father. The Father is greater than I!
"Now I told you before it takes place. That way when it happens you may believe.
"I will speak no more with you. The prince of the world comes. He has no hold on me!
"The world must know that I love the Father. And I obey the Father’s commandments. Get up and let us leave here."
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator.
"He takes away the branches in me that do not bear fruit. He cleans every branch that bears fruit. That way it may bear more fruit.
"You are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.
"Remain with me, and I with you. The branch cannot bear fruit by itself. It must remain on the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain with me.
"I am the vine and you are the branches. He that remains with me, and I with him, the same bears much fruit. You can do nothing apart from me.
"If a man does not remain with me, he is removed as a branch, and withers. They gather them and throw them into the fire where they are burned destroyed consumed.
"If you remain with me, and my words remain with you, ask whatever you will, and it will be done for you.
"My Father is glorified when you bear much fruit. You will be my disciples.
"I love you just as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.
"If you obey my commandments you will remain in my love. I have obeyed my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
"I spoke these things in order that my joy may continue with you and your joy may be made full.
"This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.
"No man has greater love then this that a man lay down his life for his friends.
"You are my friends if you do the things that I command you.
"I no longer call you servants for the servant does not know what the lord does. I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
"You did not choose me. I chose you and appointed you. You should go and bear fruit and your fruit should remain. Whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
"These things I command you, that you may love one another.
"If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.
"If you were of the world, the world would love its own. I chose you out of the world. The world hates you because you are not of the world.
"Remember the word I said to you. A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my word, they will obey yours also.
"They will do all these things to you for my name’s sake. It is because they do not know the one that sent me.
"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin. Now they have no excuse for their sin!
"He who hates me hates my Father also.
"If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would have no sin. They have seen and hated both my Father and me.
"This took place that the word written in the Law may be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause.
"I will send the helper from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father to bear witness of me.
"You also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning."
"I have spoken these things to you that you should not be made to stumble.
"They will throw you out of the synagogues. Yes, the hour comes that whoever kills you will think that he offered service to God.
"But they do these things because they do not know the Father or me.
"I tell you these things so you will remember that I told you when the time comes. I did not tell this from the beginning because I was with you.
"I go to him that sent me. None of you asks me: Where are you going?
"Now that I have spoken these things to you, sorrow fills your heart.
"Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is for your benefit that I go away. For if I do not go away the helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send it to you. Greek: autos: it
"Upon arrival this one will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.
"First of sin because they do not practice active faith in me.
"Second, of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will not see me anymore.
"And third, of judgment because the prince of this world has been judged.
"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot endure them now.
"When the Spirit of truth comes it will guide you to all truth for it will not speak from itself. It will speak the things it hears and declare to you the things that are to come.
"It will glorify me and will take of what I have and declare it to you.
"All the things the Father has are mine. That is why I said the Spirit takes what I have and declares it to you.
"A little while and you will see me no more and again a little while, and you will see me."
Some of his disciples said to one another: "What is this he says, a little while, and you see me no more and again a little while and you will see me because I go to the Father?
"What is this that he says: A little while? We do not know what he says."
Jesus perceived what they wanted to ask him. He said to them: "You inquire among yourselves concerning what I said. A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?
"Truly I tell you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
"A woman in tribulation has sorrow, because her hour to give birth has come. When she delivers the child, she remembers no more anguish, because of the joy that a man is born into the world.
"You have sorrow now. But I will see you again. Your heart will rejoice and no one can take your joy from you.
"You will ask me for nothing then. Truly I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.
"Until now you have not asked a single thing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
"I have spoken to you in figurative language illustrations and proverbs. The hour comes when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language. I will tell you plainly from the Father.
"In that day you will ask in my name. I do not say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you. It will not be necessary.
The Father loves you, because you loved me, and believed that I came from the Father.
"I came out from the Father and came into the world. I leave the world and go to the Father."
His disciples said: "See now you speak plainly and use no figurative language.
"We are sure you know all things and have no need that any man ask you questions. Because of this we believe you came from God."
Jesus asked them: "Do you now believe?
"Behold! The hour comes, and indeed, it is here, that you will be scattered and each one will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.
"I spoke to you that in me you might have peace. In the world you have tribulation. Be of good cheer for I have conquered the world!"
Jesus spoke these things and lifted up his eyes to heaven. He said: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that the son may glorify you.
"You have given him authority over all flesh that he may give everlasting life to the ones whom you have given him.
"This is everlasting life that they should have deep, intimate knowledge of you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have commissioned. Greek: ginosko: know, perceive, be sure, understand
"I glorified you on the earth. I accomplished the work you gave me to do.
"And now, Father, glorify me with you, the glory that I had with you before the world existed.
"I taught your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours and you gave them to me. They have lived by your word.
"Now they know that all things you gave me are from you.
"I gave them the words that you gave me. They understood them and knew I came from you. They believed you sent me.
"I pray for them. I do not pray for the world. I pray only for those you gave me, for they are yours.
"All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine and I am glorified in them.
"I am no more in the world but they are in the world. I come to you Holy Father. Keep them in your name, which you have given to me, that they may be one, even as we are. Greek: heis; united in purpose and love
"While I was with them I kept them in your name, which you have given to me. I guarded them, and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
"Now I come to you. I spoke these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
"I gave them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
"I do not pray that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.
"They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
"Sanctify them by your truth. Your word is truth.
"As you commissioned sent me into the world, I commissioned sent them into the world.
"I sanctify myself for them, that they may be sanctified by truth.
"I pray, not for these alone but for those who will believe in me through their word.
"May they all be united in agreement as one. Just as you, Father, are with me, and I am with you. Help them be united with us! That way the world may believe that you sent me.
"I have given them the glory that you gave me in order that they may be one even as we are one.
"I with them, and you with me, that they may accomplish complete unity. That way the world may know that you sent me and that you love them just as you love me.
"Father, I desire that these whom you gave me may be with me where I am. I want them to see the glory you have given me. For you loved me before the creation of the world.
"Righteous Father, the world has not known you. I know you and those you sent me know you.
"I have made your name known, and will make it known. That way your love for me may be with them and I may be with them."
When Jesus finished his prayer he and his disciples crossed the Kedron winter stream to a garden.
Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples.
Judas brought a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees there with lights and with weapons.
Jesus knew what was about to happen to him. He asked: "Whom do you seek?"
They answered him: "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus replied: "I am he." Judas the betrayer was with them.
When he said to them I am he they drew back and fell to the ground.
Again he asked: "Whom do you seek?" And they said: "Jesus of Nazareth."
Jesus answered: "I told you that I am he. If you seek me let these go their way."
That way the word he spoke might be fulfilled; ‘ I lost none of those you gave me. ’
Simon Peter drew the sword he had, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
Jesus said to Peter: "Put the sword in the sheath. Shall I drink the cup the Father has given me?"
The soldiers, the military commanders, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him.
They led him to Annas first for he was father in law to Caiaphas who was high priest that year.
Caiaphas was the man who gave counsel to the Jews that it was for their benefit that one man should die for the people.
Simon Peter followed Jesus and so did another disciple. The high priest knew that disciple. He entered the court of the high priest with Jesus.
Peter stood outside the door. The disciple known by the high priest went out and spoke to the woman who kept the door and he brought in Peter.
The maid that kept the door asked Peter: "Are you also one of this man’s disciples?" He said: "I am not."
It was cold. So the servants and officers warmed themselves by the fire. Peter also stood by the fire to get warm.
The high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about the things he taught.
Jesus answered him: "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple where all the Jews gathered. I spoke nothing in secret.
"Why do you ask me? Ask them that heard me what I spoke to them. They know the things I said."
When he said this one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus with his hand, saying: "You answer the high priest!"
Jesus answered him: "If I spoke evil, bear witness of the evil. But if I spoke honestly, why do you strike me?"
Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
Simon Peter stood nearby warming himself. They asked him: "Are you also one of his disciples?" He denied it saying: "I am not."
One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said: "Did I see you in the garden with him?"
Peter denied it again. Then the cock crowed.
They lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early and they did not enter directly into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
Pilate went to them and asked: "What accusation do you make against this man?"
They answered: "If this man were not an evildoer we would not deliver him to you."
Pilate replied: "Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law." The Jews said: "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."
Thus the word of Jesus would be fulfilled when he spoke about the kind of death he would experience.
Pilate entered again into the Praetorium. He called Jesus and asked him: "Are you the King of the Jews?"
Jesus answered: "You say this about me. Or did others tell you it concerning me?"
Pilate answered: "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me! What have you done?"
Jesus answered: "My kingdom is not of this world! If my kingdom were of this world my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews. My kingdom is not from this domain."
Pilate said: "Are you a king then?" Jesus answered: "As you say I am a king. I was born and came into the world for this purpose, that I should bear witness to the truth! Every one who is of the truth hears my voice."
Pilate then asked: "What is truth?" After saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them: "I find no fault in him.
"You have a custom that I release someone to you at the Passover. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
They cried out: "Not this man, but Barabbas. Barabbas was a robber."
Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him.
The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They dressed him in a purple garment.
They came to him, and said: "Hail, King of the Jews!" They struck him with their hands.
Pilate went out again, and said to them: "Look, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him."
Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said: "Look, the man!"
When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out: "Impale him! Impale him!" Pilate replied: "Take him yourselves, and impale him for he has committed no crime!"
The Jews answered him: "We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
When Pilate heard this he was more afraid.
He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus: "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
Pilate said: "Will you not speak to me? Do you know I have the power to release you and the power to impale you?"
Jesus answered him: "You would have no power against me except it was given you from above. Therefore he that delivered me to you has greater sin."
As a result of this Pilate sought to release him. The Jews cried out: "If you release this man you are not Caesar’s friend. Every one that makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."
When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment-seat. They were at a place called The Stone Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
Now it was the Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: "Behold, your King!"
They cried out: "Away with him, away with him, impale him!" Pilate asked: "Should I impale your King?" The chief priests answered: "We have no king but Caesar."
Then he delivered him to them to be impaled.
They took Jesus bearing his own stake to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
They impaled him there. Two others were impaled and Jesus stake was placed in the middle.
Pilate wrote a title and put it on the stake. There it was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
This title was read by many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was impaled was near the city. It was written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.
The chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: "Do not write, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
Pilate answered: "What I have written, I have written."
After they impaled Jesus the soldiers took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier. The coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
They said to one another, Let us not tear the coat. So they cast lots for it. That fulfilled the scripture that said: "They parted my garments among them, and they cast lots for my covering."
His mother stood by the stake of Jesus, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved. He said to his mother, "Woman, look, your son!"
Then he said to the disciple, "Look, your mother!" That hour forward the disciple took her to his home.
He knew that it was over. In order that the scripture might be accomplished, he said: "I thirst."
A vessel full of vinegar was setting there. They put a sponge full of vinegar upon a hyssop branch and brought it to his mouth.
When Jesus received the vinegar, he said, "it is finished." He bowed his head, and he stopped breathing.
It was Preparation and the Jews insisted that bodies not remain on the stake on the Sabbath. The day of that Sabbath was a high day. They asked Pilate that the legs be broken and that they might be taken away.
The soldiers broke the legs of the two who were impaled with him.
When they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already so they did not break his legs.
The soldier with the spear pierced his side and suddenly blood and water came out.
He who saw testified and his testimony is true. He knows and he speaks truth that you also may believe.
These things came to pass in order that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken.
And again another scripture said: They should look on him whom they pierced.
Joseph of Arimathaea was a disciple of Jesus. He approached Pilate secretly for fear of the Jews. He asked Pilate for permission to take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission. So he took the body away.
Nicodemus also came with a mixture of myrrh and about a hundred pounds of aloes. Nicodemus is the one who came to Jesus at night.
They prepared the body of Jesus for burial. They bound it in linen cloths with spices. This was the custom of the Jews.
There was a garden at the place where he was impaled. It contained a new tomb where no one had been buried.
They laid Jesus there because the Jews Preparation was close at hand.
Mary Magdalene arrived at the tomb early on the first day of the week while it was still dark. She saw the stone was taken away from the tomb.
She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them: "They have taken the Lord away out of the tomb. We do not know where they laid him."
Peter and the other disciple went to the tomb.
They both ran together. The other disciple out ran Peter and got to the tomb first.
He stooped and looked inside where he saw the linen clothes. He did not enter.
Simon Peter followed him to the tomb and entered to see the linen clothes laying there.
The napkin that was on his head was not with the linen clothes. It was rolled up by itself.
The other disciple entered the tomb. He saw and believed.
They still did not know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.
The disciples went away again to their own home.
Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. She stooped and looked into the tomb.
She saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
"Woman why do you weep," they asked? She told them: "They have taken my Lord and I do not know where they laid him."
She turned and look there was Jesus standing nearby. She did not know it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her: "Woman, why do you weep? Who are you looking for?" She thought he was the gardener. She said: "Sir, if you have carried him somewhere else tell me where you laid him and I will take him away."
Jesus said: "Mary." She turned and said to him in Hebrew: "Rabboni," which is to say, Teacher.
Jesus said: "Do not touch me for I am not yet ascended to the Father. Go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and you ’ re Father, and my God and your God."
Mary Magdalene went to tell the disciples: "I have seen the Lord! He said these things to me."
It was evening of the first day of the week. The disciples shut the doors where they stayed for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: "May you have Peace."
When he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were glad, when they saw the Lord.
Jesus therefore said to them again: "May you have peace. As the Father sent me, even so I send you."
After he said this he breathed on them and said: "Receive Holy Spirit.
"Forgive sins and they are forgiven. Do not forgive sins and they are not forgiven."
Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
The other disciples therefore said to him: "We have seen the Lord." He said: "Unless I feel the print of the nails in his hands and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
Eight days later the disciples were inside with the doors shut and Thomas was with them. Jesus came in and stood in the midst, and said: "Peace be with you."
Jesus said to Thomas: "Put your finger here and look at my hands. Put your hand into my side. Stop doubting and believe!"
Thomas answered: "My Lord and my God!"
Jesus said to him: "Because you saw me, you believe. Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet believe!"
Jesus did many miracles signs in the presence of the disciples. They are not written in this book.
These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. By believing you may have life in his name.
Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He presented himself this way.
There were together Simon Peter; Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
Simon Peter said to them: "I am going fishing." They told him: "We would also come with you." They boarded the boat and caught nothing that night.
Jesus stood on the beach at daybreak. The disciples did not know it was Jesus.
Jesus said to them: "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered him: "No."
He said: "Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find fish." They cast it and they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: "It is the Lord." So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat about him for he was dressed only in undergarments, and jumped into the sea.
The other disciples came in the little boat for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net full of fishes.
When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it, and bread.
Jesus said: "Bring the fish you caught."
Simon Peter went to draw the net to land. It was full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty three in all. There were so many and yet the net was not torn.
Jesus said to them: "Come and eat." And none of the disciples dared to inquire, who are you? They just knew it was the Lord.
Jesus came, took the bread and fish and gave it to them.
This is the third time Jesus was seen by the disciples since he was raised from the dead.
When they had eaten Jesus said to Simon Peter: "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said: "Yes Lord; you know I have affection for you." Jesus said to him: "Feed my lambs."
He spoke to him a second time: "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He replied: "Yes Lord, you know I have affection for you." Then Jesus said: "Shepherd my sheep."
The third time Jesus said to him: "Simon, son of John, do you have affection for me?" Peter was grieved. Because he said to him the third time, do you have affection for me? Peter replied: "Lord, you know all things; you know I have affection for you!" Jesus said to him: "Feed my sheep."
"Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young you dressed yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you become old, you stretch out your hands and another dresses you, and carries you where you do not want to go."
Now this he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. After he spoke he said: "Follow me."
Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following. He is the one who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said," Lord, who is he that betrays you?"
Seeing this Peter said to Jesus: Lord, what shall this man do?
Jesus said: "If it is my will that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."
This expression went among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say that he should not die. He only said: "If I will that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"
This is the disciple that bears witness of these things, and wrote these things. That way we know that his witness is true.
There are many other things that Jesus did. Should all of them be written I suppose the world would not contain the books written.
The first account I composed, O Theophilus, was about all that Jesus did and taught,
until the day he was received up to heaven. After that he gave orders through the Holy Spirit to his chosen apostles.
He presented himself alive to them after his suffering. He gave many convincing proofs. He appeared to them during forty days speaking about the kingdom of God.
When they were gathered together he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem. They were to wait for the promise of the Father that he spoke about.
"John baptized with water; but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days," He said.
When they met they asked him: "Lord will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?"
He replied: "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has set within His own authority.
"You will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
When he said these things, while they watched, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
They gazed intently into the sky as he went into heaven. Two men wearing white stood beside them.
They said: "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven will come in a similar manner as you saw him go into heaven."
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.
When they entered the city they went to the upper chamber where they were staying. Included were Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealous one, and Judas the son of James.
They all continued united in earnest prayer. The women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers were also there.
In these days Peter stood up among the brothers about a hundred and twenty, and said:
"Brothers, the Scripture needed to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus.
"He was numbered among us, and shared in this ministry.
"This man obtained a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open and all his intestines spilled out. The rope broke or the branch on which it was tied broke. Then he fell to the ground and burst open.
"It became known to all who live in Jerusalem that the field was called the field of blood, in their language; Akeldama.
"It is written in the book of Psalms: ‘ Let his habitation be made desolate and let no man dwell there. Let another take his office. ’
"Someone must join us as a witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. He must be one of the men who were in our group during the time that the Lord Jesus traveled about with us. This should be from the time John preached his message of baptism until the day Jesus was taken up from us to heaven.
"One who was with us from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
They proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
They prayed: "You O Jehovah, know the hearts of all men. Show us which of these men you choose.
"Which of these men should assume this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."
They cast lots for them and the lot fell on Matthias. So he was included with the eleven apostles.
When the day of Pentecost came, they were all with one accord in one place.
Suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind. It filled the house where they were sitting.
Tongues of fire that sat on each of them appeared.
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to speak with different tongues, as the Spirit moved them to speak.
Devout Jews from every nation under heaven were dwelling at Jerusalem.
When they heard this sound a crowd came together in confusion, because men heard them speak in their own language.
And they were all amazed and marveled. They said to each other: "Behold, are not all these that speak Galileans?"
"How do we each hear them in our own language?
"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
"Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
"Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speak in our language the wonderful works of God."
And they were all amazed and were in doubt. They asked each other: "What does this mean?"
Others mockingly said: "These men are full of new wine."
But Peter, stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them: "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem let me explain this to you. Listen to my words.
"These men are not drunk as you suppose for it is only nine o ’ clock in the morning.
"This is what the prophet Joel spoke about:
"It will come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh. Greek: apo, from Your sons and your daughters will prophesy proclaim God’s Word. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.
"And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out a portion from some of my Spirit in those days and they will prophesy:
"I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath: blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.
"The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable awesome Day of Jehovah arrives.
"It will come to pass, that whoever will call on the name of Jehovah will be saved.
"You men of Israel hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God came among you with miracles and wonders and signs. God did these by him in your midst, as you also know:
"You took this man and delivered him by the determined counsel purpose and foreknowledge of God. With wicked hands you impaled and murdered him.
"God resurrected him, loosing the pains of death. This is because it was not possible that he should be held fast by it.
"David spoke concerning him: ‘ I had Jehovah always before my face, for he is at my right hand, that I should not be shaken.
‘ "Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
‘ "Because you will not leave me in the grave, neither will you allow your Holy One to see corruption.
‘ "You have made known to me the ways of life, and you will fill me with joy with your presence. ’
"Men and brothers let me freely speak to you about the patriarch David that he is dead and buried. His grave is with us to this day.
"Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.
"He seeing this before spoke about the resurrection of Christ. That he would not be left in the grave and his flesh did not see corruption.
"God resurrected Jesus and we all witnessed this!
« He is exalted to the right hand of God. He has received the promised Holy Spirit from the Father. So he poured out what you now see and hear.
"For David has not ascended into heaven and yet he said: ‘ Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
‘ "until I make your enemies your footstool. ’
"Therefore let all the house of Israel know for sure that God has made that same Jesus, whom you impaled, both Lord and Christ."
Now when they heard this, they were stabbed to the heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles: "Men and brothers, what shall we do?"
Then Peter said: "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
"The promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as Jehovah our God calls."
He gave a thorough witness with many words and exhorted them, saying: "Save yourselves from this indecent generation."
Those who gladly received his word were baptized. About three thousand persons were added the same day.
They continued devoting themselves to doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
Every person experienced a sense of awe, for the apostles did many wonders and signs.
All those who believed stayed together. They held all things in common.
They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all men, as every man had need.
They continued daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house. They ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart.
As they praised God, they had favor with all the people. God added to the congregation daily those being saved.
Peter and John went up to the temple at the hour of prayer. It was the ninth hour.
A man who had been crippled from birth was carried to the gate of the temple called Beautiful. There he begged for handouts from those who entered the temple.
Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple he begged from them.
Peter and John looked at him and said: "Look at us."
He looked at them expecting to receive something from them.
Then Peter said: "We have no money but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
He took him by the right hand, and lifted him up. Immediately his feet and anklebones received strength.
He leaped up, stood and walked. He entered the temple with them walking, and leaping, and praising God.
All the people saw him walking and praising God.
They knew he was the one who begged at the Beautiful gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement because of what happened to him.
The beggar held on to Peter and John while all the people came to them at the place called Solomon’s Colonnade.
When Peter saw this he spoke to the people: "You men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why do you look at us as though our own power or holiness made this man walk?
"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus. You handed him over to Pilate. When he was determined to let him go you denied him.
"You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and requested a murderer to be released to you.
"You killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead. We witnessed this!
"This man you see and know was made strong by his faith in the name of Jesus. His faith has given him total healing in your presence.
"Brothers, I know you acted in ignorance just as your rulers did.
"The things God fulfilled he announced beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.
"Repent therefore, and turn around, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times seasons of refreshing shall come from the presence of Jehovah.
"He will send Jesus Christ, who preached to you.
whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things. God spoke about this through all his holy prophets since the world began.
"Moses said to the fathers, ‘ Jehovah will raise up for your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to all the things he speaks to you. ’
"It will happen. Every person who will not listen to the prophet will be destroyed from among the people.
"Yes, all the prophets from Samuel and his successors also announced these days.
"You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with our fathers. He said to Abraham: ‘ All the families of the earth will be blessed in your seed. ’
"God raised up his servant and sent him to you first. He sent him to bless you and to turn every one of you from your wicked ways."
As they spoke to the people, the chief priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them.
They were annoyed because they taught the people through Jesus. They preached the resurrection from the dead.
They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day for it was already evening.
Many who heard the word believed. There were about five thousand men.
The next morning their rulers, elders, scribes,
Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
They stood them in their presence and asked: "By what power or by what name do you do this?"
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said: "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
"If we are on trial for a good deed done to a sick man, concerning how this man was made well;
"Let it be known to you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you impaled and whom God raised from the dead, even by him this man stands before you healed.
"This is the stone that was rejected by you builders. It became the chief corner stone.
"There is no salvation in anyone else. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."
They observed the confidence of Peter and John. Yet they thought they were uneducated not formally educated and ordinary men. They were amazed and recognized them as having been with Jesus.
Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
They ordered them to leave the council. Then they conferred among themselves.
They said: "What shall we do to these men? The fact that a notable miracle has been done by them is evident to all who live in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny it.
"We must warn these men not to speak about it in order to stop this from spreading further among the people."
They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
Peter and John answered: "You judge whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God.
"We cannot stop speaking the things we have seen and heard."
When they further threatened them, they let them go. They found no basis for punishment because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done.
The man who received the miracle of healing was about forty years old.
Being released, they went to their own and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them.
When they heard they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said: "Jehovah, you are God, who made heaven and earth, the sea and all in them.
"You spoke by the mouth of your servant David: Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
"The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against Jehovah, and against his Christ.
Truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the people of the nations and the people of Israel, were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed.
"They were there to do the things your hand and council foreordained to occur.
"Now Jehovah behold their threats and grant that your servants keep speaking your word with boldness.
"You extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders appear in the name of your holy servant Jesus."
When they prayed, the place where they assembled together was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
The congregation that believed was of one heart and mind. No one claimed his or her own possessions for everything was common property.
The apostles witnessed about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. Grace God’s loving kindness was upon them all.
There was no needy person among them for as many as possessed land or houses sold them, and brought the money from the things that were sold.
They gave it to the apostles. Distribution was made to every man according as he had need.
Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, this meaning: The son of consolation, was a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus.
He sold his land and brought the money to the apostles.
But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.
They kept back part of the money. His wife was also knowledgeable of the transaction. They brought part of the funds to the apostles.
Peter said: "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the money from the land sale?
While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your power? Why did you conceive this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."
Hearing these words Ananias fell down and died. Great fear came over all those who heard these things.
The young men arose, covered him up, and carried him out, and buried him.
About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
Peter said to her: "Tell me whether you sold the land for such a price?" And she said: "Yes, we did."
Then Peter said: "How is it that you have agreed together to put Jehovah’s Spirit to the test? Look, those who buried your husband are at the door to carry you out."
Then she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in, and found her dead. They carried her out to be buried by her husband.
Great fear came upon the entire congregation who heard these things.
The apostles performed many wonders among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
None of the rest dared to associate with them, but the people held them in high esteem.
More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.
They brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and cots in order that the shadow might fall on them when Peter passed by.
Crowds came from the cities near Jerusalem. They brought sick people and people with unclean spirits and everyone of them was healed.
Then the high priest rose up, and all those of the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with zeal indignation.
They captured the apostles and put them in the common prison.
During the night God’s angel opened the prison doors, brought them out and said:
"Go stand in the temple and speak to the people all the sayings about this life."
When they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him. He called the council together and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.
The officers did not find them in the prison when they came. So they returned and said,
"We found the prison locked with the guards standing before the doors. When we opened it we did not find a man."
When the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted them. They wondered what this would come to.
Someone came to them and told them: "The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people."
Then the captain with the officers brought them in without violence. They feared the people lest they should have been stoned.
They brought them before the council and the high priest asked them:
"Did we command you not to teach in this name? Look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are willing to bring this man’s blood upon us."
Peter and the other apostles answered: "We must obey God rather than men.
"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed. You hanged him on a stake.
"God exalted him to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
"We are witnesses of these things. The Holy Spirit, which God gave to those who obey him, also witnessed."
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill them.
One of the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had a reputation among all the people. He commanded to put the apostles outside for a while.
He said to them: "You men of Israel be careful what you intend to do to these men.
"Sometime ago Theudas claimed to be somebody. About four hundred men joined and obeyed him. He was killed and they finally dispersed.
"After this man Judas of Galilee rose in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him. He also perished and all who obeyed him dispersed.
"I tell you: Leave these men alone. If this message and this work are from men it will come to nothing.
"But if it is from God, you cannot overthrow it; otherwise you may find yourselves fighting against God."
They agreed with him and called the apostles. They beat them and commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.
They left the council and rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
They taught daily in the temple and in every house. They did not cease to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
The number of disciples increased at that time. A murmuring arose on the part of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.
The twelve called the congregation of the disciples to them. They said: "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God and serve tables.
"Therefore brothers select seven men who have a good reputation. Men who are full of spirit and wisdom that we may appoint to take care of this business.
"We will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word."
The idea pleased the whole congregation. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch,
whom they set before the apostles. After they prayed, they laid their hands on them.
The word of God increased. The number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. Even a great number of priests became obedient to the faith.
Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
Certain men arose from the synagogue. It was called the synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, and Alexandrians. Some of them were from Cilicia and Asia. They argued with Stephen.
They were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.
They secretly induced me to say: "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God."
They stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and pursued him. They caught him and brought him to the council.
They brought false witnesses, which said: "This man will not stop speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
"We heard him say: ‘ This Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us. ’"
All who sat in the council looked intently at him and saw his face was like the face of an angel.
The high priest asked: "Are these things so?"
He said: "Men, brothers and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.
"He said to him: ‘ Get out of your country and away from your relatives. Go to the land that I will show you.
"He went out of the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. After his father died, God moved him to this land, where you now dwell.
"He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. Yet he promised that he would give it to him and his seed after him for a possession. This promise was made before he had a child.
"God spoke to this effect, that his seed would be alien residents in a strange land. They would enslave them, and mistreat them for four hundred years.
‘ "I will judge the nation to whom they shall be in bondage, ’ ’ said God, ‘ and after they will come serve me in this place. ’
"He gave him the covenant of circumcision. Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became father to Jacob and Jacob fathered the twelve family heads.
"The family heads were jealous of Joseph and sold him as a slave into Egypt. However, God was with him.
"And God delivered him out of all his afflictions. He gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Pharaoh made him governor over Egypt and his entire house.
"A famine and great suffering came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan. Our fathers found no food.
« When Jacob heard there was food in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit.
"The second time Joseph got acquainted with his brothers and Pharaoh was told about Joseph’s family.
"Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his family, seventy-five people.
"Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers.
"Their bodies were brought to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem.
"When the time of God’s promise to Abraham drew near, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt.
"Another king arose. He did not know Joseph.
"He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our fathers so that they cast out their young children and they did not survive.
"Moses was born then. He was divinely beautiful. He was nursed three months in his father’s house.
"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and nourished him as her own son.
"Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
"When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel.
"Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged the oppressed one by killing the Egyptian.
"He supposed his brothers would understand how God by his hand would deliver them but they did not understand.
"The next day he appeared to them while they were fighting. He wanted to unite them and said, ‘ You are brothers. Why do you wrong one another? ’
"The one who was treating his neighbor unjustly pushed him away, saying: ‘ Who made you our ruler and judge?
‘ "Will you kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday? ’
"When he heard this talk Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of Median, where he became father to two sons.
"At the end of forty years, Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai in a flame of fire in a bush.
When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. He drew near to look at it and the voice of Jehovah came to him.
"He said: I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled and did not dare to look further.
"Jehovah said: Take the sandals from your feet for the place where you stand is holy ground.
"I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come to deliver them. Come, I will send you into Egypt.
"This Moses whom they refused, saying: Who made you ruler and judge? God sent him to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
"He brought them out. He showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
"This is the Moses that said to the children of Israel, your God will raise up a prophet like me from your brothers.
"This one was with our father in the congregation in the wilderness. The angel spoke to him on Mount Sinai. He received the living oracles to give to us.
"Our fathers would not obey him. They sent him away, and in their hearts turned back again to Egypt.
"They said to Aaron: Make us gods to go in front of us. We do not know what happened to this Moses, who led us out of Egypt.
"They made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
"God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven. It is written in the book of the prophets: O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
"Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan. You made figures to worship them. I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
"Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
"Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, until the days of David;
"Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
"But Solomon built him a house.
The most High does not dwell in houses made with hands as the prophet says,
"Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool. What house will you build me? Said Jehovah God. What is the place of my rest?
"Did my hand make all these things?
"You obstinate men who are uncircumcised in heart and ears. You always resist the Holy Spirit as your fathers did.
"Which of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted? They killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one whom you have betrayed and murdered.
"You have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not obeyed it."
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart. They gnashed their teeth at him.
Being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
He said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God."
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.
They threw him out of the city, and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet. His name was Saul.
They stoned Stephen. He called out: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
He kneeled down and cried with a loud voice: "Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them." After saying this he fell asleep in death.
Saul agreed to his death. There was at that time a great persecution against the congregation at Jerusalem. All but the apostles were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.
Devout men buried Stephen and mourned him greatly.
Saul ravaged the congregation. He entered every house and dragged off men and women and put them in prison.
They who were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.
Then Philip went to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.
The people with one accord gave heed to those things Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles he did.
Unclean spirits, crying with loud voices, came out of many who were possessed by them. Many who were taken with palsies and the lame were healed.
There was great joy in that city.
A certain man called Simon was in the same city. He used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, telling everyone that he was great.
They all listened to him, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man has great power from God.
They followed him because for a long time he astonished them with sorceries.
When they believed what Philip preached about the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Simon also believed. When he was baptized he continued with Philip, amazed by the miracles and signs he saw.
When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
Peter and John prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but had not yet received the Spirit.
So they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
When Simon saw the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money.
Simon said: "Give me this power that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit."
Peter said to him: "Your money will perish with you, because you think that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
"You have no part or share in this matter for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
"Repent of this wickedness, and pray to God, that the thought in your heart may be forgiven you.
"For I perceive that you are full of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."
Simon answered: "Pray to God for me, that none of these things that you have spoken will happen to me."
When they had testified and preached the word of Jehovah they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the good news in many villages of the Samaritans.
God’s angel said to Philip: "Arise, and go toward the south the way that goes from Jerusalem unto Gaza through the desert."
He went and an Ethiopian eunuch government official, a man of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.
He was returning and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.
The Spirit said to Philip: "Go near, and climb on this chariot."
Philip ran to him, heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said: "Do you understand what you are reading?"
"How can I", the eunuch said: "unless someone explains it to me?" He invited Philip to come and sit with him.
The Scripture he read was this: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so he did not open his mouth.
"In his humiliation his judgment was taken away. Who will declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth."
The eunuch asked Philip: "Please tell me of whom is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"
Then Philip began at the same Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
On their way, they came to a body of water and the eunuch said, "See, here is water. What prevents me from getting baptized?"
Philip said: "If you believe with all your heart, you may." He answered: "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
He commanded the chariot to stop. They both went into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
After they came out of the water God’s Spirit took Philip away. The eunuch did not see him again. He continued his journey rejoicing.
Philip was seen passing through Azotus. He preached in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
Saul was still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord. He went to the high priest.
He asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, that if he found any there who belonged to The Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
As he journeyed to Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven shined around him.
He fell to the earth and heard a voice saying: "Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?"
"Who are you Lord?" He asked. The Lord said: "I am Jesus whom you persecute.
"Get up and go into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do."
The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
Saul got up from the ground. Even though he opened his eyes, he saw nothing. They led him by the hand into Damascus.
He went for three days without sight. He did not eat or drink.
The disciple Ananias was in Damascus. The Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision: "Ananias." He replied: "Yes, I am here, Lord."
The Lord said to him, "Arise, and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for he is praying.
"He has seen a man named Ananias in a vision. He came in and laid his hand on him that he might receive his sight."
Ananias answered: "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your holy ones at Jerusalem.
"He has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."
The Lord said to him: "Be on your way. This man is a chosen vessel to bear my name to the people of the nations, and kings and the children of Israel.
"I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name."
Ananias went his way. He entered the house and put his hands on him and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you along the road sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he received sight. He got up and was baptized.
He ate and was strengthened. Saul spent several days with the disciples at Damascus.
He preached in the synagogues immediately. He preached Christ the Son of God.
All who heard him were amazed. They asked: "Is he the one who raised havoc with those who called on this name in Jerusalem? Did he come for that purpose to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?"
Saul increased in power and confounded the Jews living in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
After many days the Jews took counsel to kill him.
Saul learned about their plot against him. They watched the gates day and night to kill him.
During the night the disciples let him down by the wall in a basket.
When Saul came to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples. They were afraid of him and did not believe he was a disciple.
Barnabas led him to the apostles. He declared to them how he had seen the Lord in The Way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
He was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem.
He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. He had a dispute with the Greek speaking Jews and they made attempts to kill him.
When the brothers detected this they brought him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.
The congregations throughout all Judea, Galilee and Samaria, were built up. They walked in deep respect for Jehovah and were comforted by the Holy Spirit and continued to grow.
Peter traveled through all parts. He came to the holy ones at Lydda.
He found a man named Aeneas who lay in his bed for eight years. He was sick of the palsy.
Peter said to him:" Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole! Stand up and take your bed." And he stood up immediately.
All who lived at Lydda on the Plain of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
A disciple named Tabitha was at Joppa. Her name, when translated means Dorcas. This woman did many good works and gave gifts of mercy.
She was sick, and died. They washed her body and laid her in an upper chamber.
Since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him requesting that he come to them quickly.
Peter went to them right a way. When he arrived they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
Peter put them all outside, kneeled down, and prayed. He turned to the body and said: "Tabitha, rise!" She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.
He gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then he called the holy ones and widows and presented her alive.
It became known throughout Joppa and many believed in the Lord.
He waited many days in Jappa with Simon a tanner.
There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian Band.
He was a devout man who respected God with his entire household. He gave many gifts of mercy to the people and prayed to God always.
About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw a vision. An angel of God came to him and said, "Cornelius."
He looked at him and was afraid. "What is it, Lord?" He replied. The angel said: "God hears your prayers and sees your gifts of mercy.
"Send men to Joppa to bring back Simon, whose surname is Peter:
"He is staying with a tanner named Simon whose house is by the sea."
When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was his attendant.
He told them what happened and sent them to Joppa.
The next day they journeyed to the city. As they drew near, Peter went to the housetop to pray. It was about the sixth hour.
He became very hungry. While the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance.
He saw heaven opened, something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners was descending to the earth.
In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles and birds.
Peter heard a voice say: "Kill and eat."
But Peter said: "No Lord for I have never eaten any thing that is defiled or unclean."
The voice spoke to him again the second time: "You stop calling defiled that which God has cleansed."
This happened a third time and immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven.
While Peter doubted in himself what this vision ment, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius inquired for Simon’s house, and stood at the gate.
They called out and asked if Simon surnamed Peter lived there.
While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him:" Behold, three men seek you.
"Stand up and go down to greet them. Do not doubt for I have sent them.
Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius. He said: "I am the one you are looking for. Why did you come?"
They said: "We come from Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man who respects God. He has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so he could hear what you have to say."
He invited them in to be his guests. The next day Peter went away with them. Brothers accompanied them from Joppa.
The day after that they entered Caesarea. Cornelius expected them so he called his relatives and close friends to join him.
Cornelius met Peter and fell down at his feet with adoration for him.
"Stand up," Peter said, as he lifted him up, "I am also a man."
He talked with him and went in to find many people gathered.
He said to them: "You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company, or approach someone of another nation. But God revealed to me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean.
"Therefore I came to you without objection, as soon as I was sent for. I ask therefore for what intent you sent for me?"
Cornelius replied, "Four days ago I was praying at this hour. It was the ninth hour and I prayed in my house. A man dressed in bright clothing stood before me.
"He said, ‘ Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your gifts of mercy are noticed in the sight of God.
‘ "Send to Joppa, and call Simon, whose surname is Peter. He lives in the house of the tanner named Simon by the sea. When he comes he will speak with you. ’
"Immediately I sent for you. You have done well for you have come. We are all present before God, to hear all things that are commanded to you from God."
Peter opened his mouth, and said, "I truly perceive that God shows no partiality.
"In every nation he accepts every person who respects him and does what is right.
"You know the Word of God was sent to the children of Israel. He Jehovah God presented peace through the anointed Lord or Master of all, Jesus Christ.
"You know that message which began in Galilee and was published throughout all Judea, after the baptism that John preached.
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil. God was with him.
"We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a stake.
"God raised him up the third day and made him visible.
"However, all the people did not see him. Witnesses who were previously chosen by God saw him. We who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead saw him.
"He commanded us to preach to the people. We testify that he was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
"All the prophets testify that through his name whoever believes in him will receive forgiveness of sins."
Holy Spirit descended on all who heard the message Peter spoke.
Those circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of Holy Spirit was also poured out on the people of the nations.
They heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then Peter responded:
"Can any man keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit as we have."
He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days.
The apostles and brothers in Judea heard that the people of the nations also received the word of God.
When Peter went to Jerusalem, those who favored circumcision argued with him.
They said: "You went to the uncircumcised and ate with them."
Peter started at the beginning and explained what happened.
"I was in the city of Joppa praying. In a trance I saw a vision. A vessel descended like a great sheet. It let down from heaven by four corners and it came to me.
"I looked in it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things and birds of the air.
"I heard a voice say to me, ‘ Get up Peter slaughter and eat. ’
"I said, ‘ No Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth. ’
"The voice answered me again from heaven, ‘ Do not call defiled what God has cleansed! ’
"This happened three times. Then everything was pulled up again into heaven.
"At that moment there were three men who were sent from Caesarea to me at the house where I was.
"The Spirit told me to go with them and not to doubt them. These six brothers accompanied me when we entered the man’s house.
"He showed us how he had seen an angel in his house that stood and said to him, ‘ Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter. ’
"He will bring you a message so that you and your household shall be saved.
"When I spoke the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it was in the beginning.
"Then I remembered what the Lord said, ‘ John indeed baptized with water. However you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. ’
"Since God gave them the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could oppose God?"
When they heard this they objected no more and praised God, saying: "God has granted the people of the nations repentance to life."
Those who were scattered abroad because of the persecution of Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word only to the Jews.
Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene. When they came to Antioch they spoke to the Greeks and preached the Lord Jesus.
The hand Spirit of God was with them. A great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
News of these things came to the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem. They sent Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch.
When he arrived he saw the grace of God and was glad. He exhorted them all to remain true to the Lord as their only purpose of heart.
For he was a good man full of Holy Spirit and of faith. Then many people were added to the Lord.
Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul.
When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. They met with the congregation for a whole year. They taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
Prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch at that time.
One of them was named Agabus. He indicated through the Spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire earth. He said it would come to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
The disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers in Judea.
They sent it to the elders through Barnabas and Saul.
At that time Herod the king mistreated those of the congregation.
He killed James the brother of John with a sword.
He saw that it pleased the Jews so he captured Peter also. This happened during the feast of unleavened bread.
When he apprehended him, he put him in prison. He turned him over to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him. After Passover he would be presented to the people.
Peter was kept in prison. Prayer was made without ceasing by the congregation to God for him.
It was the night before Herod was to bring him to trial. Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. He was bound with two chains. Sentries stood guard at the prison door.
Suddenly God’s angel came to him. A light shined in the prison. He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up saying: "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off of his hands.
The angel said: "Dress yourself and put on sandals. Put on your coat and follow me." So Peter did as he was told.
Peter followed him out of the prison. He did not know what the angel was doing was really happening. He thought he saw a vision.
They went past the first and second guard to the Iron Gate that leads to the city. The gate opened and went out on the street. The angel then departed from him.
Peter came to himself and he said: "Now I know for sure that God sent his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jews."
After he thought about what happened he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark. Many were gathered there to pray.
Peter knocked on the door and a young woman named Rhoda answered.
When she recognized Peter’s voice she was so overjoyed she ran back into the house to tell others he was there. She forgot to open the door for him.
They said to her: "You are mad." But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said: "It must be his angel."
But Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.
Peter motioned for them to be quiet. Then he told them how God brought him out of the prison. He said: "Tell James and the brothers." Then he went away to another place.
When day came the soldiers were disturbed by what happened to Peter.
Herod had a thorough search made for him and could not find him. He cross examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Herod went from Judea to Caesarea to stay for a while.
Herod highly disagreed with them at Tyre and Sidon. But they finally came to an agreement. They secured the support of Blastus a trusted personal servant of the king. They desired peace because their country was supported by the king’s country.
Dressed in royal apparel, Herod delivered a public address to the people on a special day.
The people shouted: "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man."
Immediately the angel of God killed him, because he did not give God the glory. He was eaten by worms and died.
The word of God increased and spread.
Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission. They took with them John, surnamed Mark.
There were prophets and teachers in the congregation at Antioch. This included: Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
As they ministered to God, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said: "Set Barnabas and Saul apart for the work I have called them."
After they fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them away.
Being sent by Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.
They preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews at Salamis. John was also there as an attendant.
They traveled the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they found Barjesus. He was a sorcerer, a false prophet and a Jew.
He was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
But Elymas the sorcerer opposed them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
Then Saul, who also is called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him,
And said: "You child of the devil, full of all subtlety and mischief, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of Jehovah?
"Look Jehovah’s hand is on you. You will be blind and not see the sun for a season." Immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness. He went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
When he saw what was done the deputy believed. He was astonished at the teaching of God.
Paul and his company put out to sea from Paphos. They went to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them to return to Jerusalem.
When they left Perga, they went to Antioch in Pisidia. They went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.
After the public reading of the law and the prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying: "You men and brothers if you have a message of encouragement for the people speak."
Then Paul stood up gestured with his hand and said: "Men of Israel, and you who reverence God, listen."
"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they lived as strangers in the land of Egypt. He brought them out of Egypt with his great strength.
"He cared for them and endured their bad conduct in the wilderness for forty years.
"He destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance.
"Then he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. This took about four hundred and fifty years.
"Afterward they desired a king. God gave Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, to them for forty years.
"When he removed him, he made David their king. He testified about him when he said: I found David the son of Jesse is a man after my own heart. He will do my will.
"God brought the Savior Jesus to Israel from this man’s descendants.
"Before Jesus came John preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
"As John accomplished his purpose he asked: Who do you think I am? I am not that one. One comes after me whose shoes I am not worthy to untie.
"Men and brothers, children of Abraham, and you of the nations who respect God, the message of salvation is sent to you.
"The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not know Jesus. They fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath when they condemned Jesus.
"They found no grounds for the death sentence for him. Yet they asked Pilate to put him to death.
"When they had fulfilled all that was written about him, they took him down from the stake, and laid him in a tomb.
"But God raised him from the dead:
"Those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him. They are his witnesses to the people.
"We tell you good news. It is God’s promise to the fathers.
"God has fulfilled this promise to their children by resurrecting Jesus. Just as it is written in the second psalm: You are my Son, today I have become your father.
"He raised him up from the dead, never to decay. It is stated in these words: I will give you the sure blessings promised David.
"He said in another psalm: You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.
"After David served his own generation by doing the will of God he died and was buried with his fathers. His body decayed.
"But he Jesus, whom God raised again, saw no decay.
"You should know, men and brothers that it is through this man Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
"Through him all who believe are justified from all things. You could not be justified through the Law of Moses.
Beware that what the prophets said does not happen to you.
"Look among the nations, watch, and be amazed. Though you are told you will not believe the work I do today."
When the Jews left the synagogue the people asked for this message to be preached to them the next Sabbath.
When the congregation dismissed, many followed Paul and Barnabas. They urged them to continue in the grace of God.
Nearly the entire city gathered the next Sabbath day to hear the word of God.
When the Jews saw the crowds they were filled with envy. They spoke against those things Paul spoke. They contradicted and blasphemed him.
Paul and Barnabas became very bold, and said: "It was necessary that the Word of God should first be spoken to you. But seeing you reject it you judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life! Therefore we turn to the people of the nations.
"Jehovah commanded us with these words: I appoint you as a light to the nations. My salvation will come to the ends of the earth."
And when the people of the nations heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were receptive to eternal life believed.
The word of God Greek: kurios: God was published throughout the entire region.
The Jews incited the devout and honorable women and the leading men of the city. They caused persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their coasts.
So they shook the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium.
The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
Paul and Barnabas entered the synagogue of the Jews at Iconium. There they spoke to a great crowd of Jews and Greeks who became believers.
The unbelieving Jews stirred up the people of the nations and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
The apostles stayed there for a long time. They spoke boldly by the authority of God who proved that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to perform miracles and wonders.
The people of the city were divided. Some were for the Jews and others for the apostles.
Then some of the people of the nations and Jews, together with their leaders, decided to mistreat the apostles and stone them.
They knew about it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the country around them.
They preached the good news there, too.
A man with crippled feet sat in Lystra. He had never walked for he was lame from birth.
He heard Paul speaking. Paul looked intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
said with a loud voice: "Stand up on your feet!" And he leaped up and walked.
Seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian: "The gods have come down to us, becoming like men."
They called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
Then the priest of Jupiter whose temple was there in the city, brought cattle and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
When the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they ripped their clothes, and ran in among the people.
They said: "Sirs, why do you do these things? We are only men like you. We bring you good news. You should turn from these worthless things to the living God. He is the God who made heaven and earth, the sea and all things.
"In the past he let all nations to walk in their own ways.
"He has not left himself without witness. For he did good and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
Even with these words they found it hard to keep the crowd from sacrificing to them.
Jews from Antioch and Iconium took control of the crowd. They persuaded the people to stone Paul. Then they threw him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
The disciples gathered around him and he stood up. They went into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
After they preached the good news to that city and taught many, they returned again to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.
They strengthened the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith. They said, "We must enter the kingdom of God through much tribulation."
When they had ordained elders in every congregation they prayed with fasting. They commended them to God, on whom they believed.
After they passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
After they had preached the word in Perga they went down into Attalia.
They sailed to Antioch, where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work they completed.
The congregation gathered and reported all God had done with them how he had opened the door of faith to the nations.
They stayed with the disciples for a long time.
Some men came down from Judea to teach the brothers. They said: "You cannot be saved unless you become circumcised according to the custom of Moses."
Paul and Barnabas had an intense harsh dispute and debate with them. They concluded that Paul, Barnabas, and others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders to settle this question.
The congregation sent them on their way. They passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations. They brought great joy to all the brothers.
Then they went to Jerusalem where the apostles and elders and congregation greeted them. They declared all the things that God had done for them.
The believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stated: "It is needed to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses."
The apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.
After much discussion Peter got up and said: "Men and brothers you know that God made a choice among us, that I would preach the good news to the nations that they may hear and believe.
"God knows their hearts and showed that he accepted them by giving them Holy Spirit just as he did to us.
"He made no distinction between them and us and purified their hearts by faith.
"Why do you test God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, one that our fathers were not able to bear?
"We believe we are saved through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, as they also are."
The crowd kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul. They declared the miracles and wonders God performed through them among the people of the nations.
When they finished talking James said: "Brothers listen to me:
"Simeon declared how God first visited the nations to take out of them a people for his name.
"The words of the prophets agree to this for it is written:
"I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down. I will rebuild its ruins. I will restore it.
"That the rest of mankind might seek after Jehovah, and all the nations, upon whom my name is called, Jehovah said, who is doing these things.
"Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
"Therefore it is my decision not to trouble those of the nations who have turned to God.
"We should write to them that they should abstain from things polluted by idols, from fornication, from things strangled and from blood.
"Moses has been preached in the synagogues from old times until now every Sabbath day."
The apostles and elders along with the whole congregation desired to send chosen men to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.
They wrote letters as follows: "The apostles, elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers who are of the nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.
So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the crowd together, they delivered the letter.
When they read it they rejoiced over the encouragement.
Judas and Silas, being prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.
After they stayed there a while in peace, the brothers sent them back to the apostles.
It pleased Silas to stay there.
Paul and Barnabas stayed at Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of God, with many others also.
After time passed Paul said to Barnabas: "Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the Word of God, and see how they are doing."
Barnabas decided to take John, whose surname was Mark, with them.
Paul did not think it a good idea to take him with them. So he left them at Pamphylia.
Their disagreement was so great between them that they parted company. So Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus.
Paul chose Silas, and departed, being entrusted by the brothers to the grace of God.
He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.
Paul arrived at Derbe and Lystra where he saw a disciple named Timothy. He was the son of a Jewish woman, and his father was a Greek.
The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
Paul wanted to have him travel with him. So he had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in the area. For they knew that his father was a Greek.
They went through the towns and delivered to the believers the rules decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. They told them to obey those rules.
The congregations were made stronger in the faith and grew in numbers every day.
The Holy Spirit did not let them preach the message in the province of Asia. So they traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia.
When they reached the border of Mysia, they tried to go into the province of Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
They traveled through Mysia and went to Troas.
Paul had a vision that night. In it he saw a Macedonian standing and pleading with him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us!"
After Paul had this vision, we got ready to leave for Macedonia. We decided that God had called us to preach the good news to the people there.
We left by ship from Troas and sailed to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.
From there we went inland to Philippi, a city of the first district of Macedonia. It is also a Roman colony. We spent several days there.
On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the river where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women who gathered there.
A woman named Lydia who was a seller of purple came from Thyatira. She worshipped God because God opened her heart to listen to the things spoken by Paul.
When she and her household were baptized she came to us saying, "If you judge me to be faithful to God, come to my house, and stay there." She absolutely insisted that we come.
A young woman who had a spirit of divination met us as we were going to the place of prayer. She brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
She followed Paul and cried out: "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation."
She did this for many days. This troubled Paul. So he turned and said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out that very hour.
When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
They took them to the magistrates and said: "These men, being Jews, cause great trouble in our city.
"They offer customs that it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans."
The crowd rose up against them. The magistrates ripped their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.
After they were severely beaten, they threw them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safe.
Receiving this command he threw them into the inner prison, and fastened their feet in the stocks.
Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God at midnight. The prisoners were listening to them.
Suddenly there was a massive earthquake. It was so great the foundations of the prison-house were shaken. All the doors were opened and everyone’s bands came off.
The jailor, who was roused out of sleep and saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Paul cried with a loud voice: "Do not harm yourself for we are all here."
The jailer called for lights. He rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
He brought them out and asked: "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
They said: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house."
They spoke the Word of God to him and those in his house.
That very hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds. Then he and all his family were baptized.
He took them to his house and fed them. They rejoiced along with his entire house, having believed in God.
The next day the magistrates sent the officers saying: "Let those men go."
The jailor reported the words to Paul, saying: "The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore go in peace."
Paul said to them: "They have beaten us publicly uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison. Do they now throw us out privately? No I say, but let them come in person to bring us out."
The officers reported these words to the magistrates. They feared when they heard that they were Romans.
They personally came to them and brought them out. They asked them to go away from the city.
They left the prison and entered the house of Lydia. When they saw the brothers they comforted them and then left.
They passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Paul went in, for it was his custom. He reasoned with them from the Scriptures for three Sabbath days.
He explained and proved that Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. And that Jesus is the Messiah.
Some of them were convinced believed and joined with Paul and Silas. A large crowd of the devout Greeks and of the prominent women also joined.
The Jews were moved with jealousy so they gathered bad people who organized a crowd for a riot. They assaulted the house of Jason in order to bring them out to the crowd.
When they did not find them they dragged Jason and other brothers before the rulers of the city. They said: "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also."
Jason welcomed them. They all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.
The crowd and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.
They made Jason post bond and they let them go.
The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived there they went to the synagogue of the Jews.
The Bereans were nobler than those in Thessalonica because they received the word with all readiness of mind and examined the Scriptures daily to see if what Paul told them was true.
Many of them believed. So did the prominent Greek women and prominent men.
When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Beroea, they went there and stirred up the crowds and caused trouble.
The brothers immediately sent Paul to the sea. Silas and Timothy stayed at Beroea.
Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens. He sent orders to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible.
Paul waited for them at Athens. His spirit was irritated within him when he saw the city full of idols.
So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and devout persons. He went to the marketplace every day with those who would meet with him.
The Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. Some said: What is this babbler saying? Others: He seems to be advocating strange gods because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
They took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus. They said, "May we know what is this new teaching?
"You bring strange ideas to our ears. We want to know what these things mean."
The Athenians and the strangers who lived there spent their time doing nothing else except talking about and listening to new ideas.
Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said: "Men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that you are very religious.
« As I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: "To An Unknown God." What you worship as unknown, this I will proclaim to you.
"The God that made the world and all things in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He does not live in temples made with hands.
"Men’s hands do not serve him as if he needed anything. He gives life and breath to all.
"From one person he made every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth. He determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation.
"God did this so man could seek him and might find him. He is not far from each one of us.
"In him we live, and move, and have our existence. Your own poets have said: For we are also his offspring.
"Being then the offspring of God, we should not think that the divine being is like gold, or silver, or stone, a device made by man’s design or skill.
"God overlooked the times of ignorance; but now he commands men everywhere to repent.
"He has established a day time in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man Jesus whom he has ordained. Of that he gives proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead."
Some mocked when they heard about the resurrection of the dead. Yet others said: "We will hear you again concerning this".
Thus Paul went out from among them.
Some men joined themselves to him and believed. Included among the believers were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
After this Paul left Athens to go to Corinth.
There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus who is currently from Italy with his wife Priscilla. Claudius commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. So he came to them.
He was of the same trade as Paul. So he stayed with them and worked at their tentmaker trade.
He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia. He witnessed to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
When they opposed Paul and treated him abusively he shook out his garment and said to them: "Your blood is upon your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to the people of the nations."
He left the synagogue and went next door to the house of a man named Titus Justus, one who worshiped God.
Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord and so did his household. Many of the Corinthians who heard and believed were baptized.
The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision: "Do not be afraid, but speak. Do not keep silent!
"I am with you and no man will harm you. I have many people in this city."
He lived there a year and six months teaching the word of God to them.
When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.
They said: "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
Paul was about to speak when Gallio said to the Jews: "If you Jews were about to complain about some crime it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.
"But it involves questions about words and names in your own law so look to it yourselves. I will not be judge of these matters."
He drove them from the court.
They all grabbed Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the court. Gallio did not care about this.
Paul stayed many days. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria. Also with Paul were Priscilla and Aquila. Paul clipped this hair short in Cenchreae because of a vow.
They traveled to Ephesus where he left them. Paul entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
When they asked him to stay longer he declined.
"I will return again to you if it is God’s will," Paul said. Then he set sail from Ephesus.
When he landed at Caesarea, he greeted the congregation and traveled to Antioch.
After spending some time there he departed through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.
A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was an Alexandrian who had a comprehensive knowledge of the scriptures and spoke eloquently.
This man had been instructed in God’s way. Being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.
He spoke boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him home and explained God’s word more accurately.
When he decided to travel to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him. They wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived he was a great help to those who by grace believed.
He powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country to Ephesus, and found some disciples.
He said to them: "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said: "We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit."
Paul asked: "What kind of baptism did you get?" They replied: "It was the baptism John taught."
Paul said: "John baptized with the baptism of repentance. He told the people they should believe in Jesus, the one who came after John."
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Paul laid his hands on them and Holy Spirit came upon them. They spoke with tongues and prophesied.
There were twelve men in all.
He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly reasoning and persuading about the kingdom of God. He did this for three months.
Some were obstinate and publicly maligned The Way before the crowds. He departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
This continued for two years so that all who lived in this part of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
God did special miracles by the hands of Paul.
Handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were put on the sick and the evil spirits went away.
Some Jews went around driving out evil spirits saying: "In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches I command you to come out!"
And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, and a chief priest, who did this.
The evil spirit answered and said to them: "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?"
The man who had the evil spirit jumped on them, and overpowered them. He gave them such a beating that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
This became known to all both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They were all afraid. The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Many of the believers confessed openly about the evil things they had done.
Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they totaled the value of them it came to about fifty thousand pieces of silver.
The word of God kept on growing and prevailed.
After this ended Paul was directed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he passed through Macedonia and Achaia. He said: "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
He sent two of his helpers Timothy and Erastus to Macedonia. He stayed in Asia for a while.
A great disturbance occurred about The Way.
A man named Demetrius, a silversmith made silver shrines of Diana. He brought a lot of business to the craftsmen.
They gathered together along with similar related workmen, and said: "Sirs, You know we receive a good income from this business.
"You see and hear that Paul, in Ephesus and throughout all Asia, has persuaded and turned away many people. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.
"There is danger that our trade will lose its good name. The temple of the great goddess Artemis Diana would then become useless. The goddess who is worshiped in all Asia would be robbed of her divine majesty."
When they heard this they were filled with anger. They shouted: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians."
The city was filled with the confusion. They rushed with one accord into the theatre and seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.
Paul wanted to enter the theatre with the people but his disciples would not permit it.
Some of the officials and his friends sent him a message begging him not to enter the theatre.
Some cried one thing and others another for the crowd was in confusion. Most of them did not know why they assembled.
The crowd of Jews thrust Alexander forward. Alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make a defense to the people.
They perceived that he was a Jew and all with one voice shouted for two hours: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians."
The city recorder quieted the crowd. He said: "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
"Seeing that these things are indisputable it is fitting that you keep calm and do nothing rash.
"You brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
"If Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a grievance against any man, the courts are open, and there are judges. Let them accuse one another.
"But if you seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
"For indeed we are in danger to be charged with rioting sedition because of today’s events. We would not be able to account for this ruckus for there is no reason for it."
When he finished speaking he dismissed the assembly.
After the uproar ceased Paul sent for the disciples. He encouraged them. Then he left for Macedonia.
He went to Greece after traveling through the area giving encouragement.
After three months he set sail for Syria. He decided to return through Macedonia. He left there because the Jews formed a plot against him.
Those who accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
They left early and were waiting for us at Troas.
We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread. Five days later we met them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to them. Intending to depart the next morning he prolonged his speech until midnight.
There were many lights in the upper chamber where we gathered.
A young man named Eutychus sat in the window. He was very sleepy. Paul’s talk was long and he fell asleep. He fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
Paul went down and fell on him. He embraced him and said: "Do not be troubled for he lives."
He went up and they broke bread and ate. He talked with them a long time until morning. Then he left.
The people took the young man home alive for they were greatly comforted.
We went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos. We intended to take Paul on board for he had arranged to go there on foot.
He met us at Assos and journeyed to Mitylene.
We sailed from there to Chios and then to Samos. One day later we went to Miletus.
Paul decided to sail past Ephesus so he might not spend time in Asia. He was in a hurry to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
At Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the congregation to him.
When they arrived he said: "You know from the first day that I set foot in Asia, I was with you all the time,
serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials that came on me by the plots of the Jews.
"I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house.
"I witnessed to both Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
"I am compelled by the spirit to go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there.
"Holy Spirit warns me that in every city, prison and hardships are facing me there.
"I do not consider my life of any account. It is not dear to me so that I may finish the race, and I may accomplish the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to preach the good news of the grace of God.
"I know all of you and have preached the kingdom with you. But you will not see me again.
"I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
"I did not shrink from telling you the entire will of God.
"Be on guard for yourselves and the flock that the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Feed the Congregation of God that he purchased with the blood of his own Son.
"I know that after my departing grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
"Such men will arise from among you speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.
"Be on guard! Remember I did not cease for three years to admonish you day and night with tears.
"Now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace. This is able to build you up, and to give you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
"I coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or clothes.
"You know that my own hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.
"In all things I gave you an example. You by laboring should help the weak. Remember the words of the Lord Jesus: It is more blessed to give than to receive."
When he had spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
They all wept profusely, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him. embraced him hugged him
What grieved them most was his statement that they would not see him again. They accompanied him to the ship.
After we parted from them we set sail with a straight course to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and then to Patara.
We went aboard a ship sailing to Phoenicia.
We passed to the south of Cyprus and sailed to Syria. We landed at Tyre where the ship unloaded it’s cargo.
Having found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. Guided by the Spirit the disciples urged Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
When the time came we left there and went on our journey. All the disciples, their wives and children, accompanied us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach and prayed, and said goodbye.
We went on board the ship as they returned home.
We traveled from Tyre to Ptolemais where the brothers greeted us and we stayed with them one day.
The next morning we left for Caesarea where we entered the house of Philip the evangelist and one of the seven.
Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.
As we stayed there several days, a prophet came from Judea, named Agabus.
Coming to us he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands. He said: "The Holy Spirit says, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this belt, and shall deliver him into the hands of the nations."
When we heard this everyone pleaded with Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
Why do you weep and break my heart? Paul answered: "For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
He would not be dissuaded. So we ceased, saying: The will of God be done!
We packed our baggage and went to Jerusalem.
The disciples from Caesarea brought us to the home of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we stayed.
The brothers in Jerusalem received us gladly.
The following day Paul went with us to James and the elders.
After Paul greeted them he reported in detail what God had done among the nations through his ministry.
Those who heard it glorified God. They said to him: "You see brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed. They are all zealous for the law.
"They have been informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses. You tell them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
"What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you are here.
Do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.
Take these men and join in on their purification rites. Let them shave their heads. All will know there is no truth in the things they have heard about you, that you walk orderly and keep the law.
Concerning those of the nations who have believed, we write: they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.
Then Paul took the men and became purified with them. They went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him.
They shouted: "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and defiled this holy place."
They had previously been with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple.
The entire city was aroused, and the people ran together from all directions. They laid hold on Paul and dragged him out of the Temple. Immediately the doors were shut.
They were seeking to kill him when tidings came to the military commander of the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
At once he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the military commander and the soldiers they quit beating Paul.
Then the military commander came near and laid hold on him. He commanded that he be bound with two chains. He asked who he was and what he had done.
Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another. The commander could not find out the facts because of the uproar so he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
Paul reached the steps. The violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.
The mob followed closely and shouted: "Away with him!"
And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "Might I say something to you?" He replied: "Do you know Greek?
"Are you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand assassins into the desert?"
But Paul said, "I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city and I request that you allow me to speak to the people."
The commander gave permission so Paul stood on the stairs, motioned to the people. When there was silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:
"Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now."
They heard him speak in the Hebrew tongue and became quiet.
"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up here in Jerusalem as a student of Gamaliel. I received instruction in the Law of our ancestors and was just as zealous for God as are all of you.
"I persecuted the people who followed this Way to the point of death. I arrested men and women and threw them into prison.
"The High Priest and the whole Council can prove that I am telling the truth. I received letters from them written to fellow Jews in Damascus, so I went there to arrest these people and bring them back in chains to Jerusalem to be punished.
"While I was traveling I came near Damascus about midday. Suddenly a bright light from the sky flashed around me.
"I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: ‘ Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me? ’
"Who are you, Lord?" I asked. "I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute," he said to me.
"Everyone with me saw the light. They did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.
"I asked: What shall I do, Lord? He said: ‘ Go to Damascus. There you will be told what God wants you to do. ’
"I was blind because of the bright light. So my companions took me by the hand and led me to Damascus.
"A man named Ananias was in that city. He is a religious man who obeyed our Law and was highly respected by all the Jews living there.
"He came and stood by me, and said: ‘ Brother Saul, see again! ’ ’ At that very moment I saw again and looked at him.
"He said: ‘ The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will. You are to see his righteous servant, and to hear him speak with his own voice.
‘ You will be a witness for him to tell everyone what you have seen and heard.
‘ Wait no longer! Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him. ’
"I went back to Jerusalem. Then I have a vision while I prayed in the temple.
"I saw the Lord. He said to me: ‘ Hurry and leave Jerusalem because the people here will not accept your witness about me. ’
"I answered, ‘ Lord they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you.
‘ "When your witness Stephen was put to death, I was there, approving of his murder and taking care of the coats of his murderers. ’"
"The Lord said: ‘ Go! I will send you far away to the people of the nations. ’
The people listened to Paul until he said this. Then they shouted at the top of their voices: "Away with him! Kill him! He is not fit to live!"
They were screaming, throwing off their clothes, and throwing dust up in the air.
The Roman commander ordered his men to take Paul into the barracks. He told them to whip him in order to find out why the Jews were screaming like this against him.
When they tied him up to be whipped Paul said to the officer standing there, "Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who has not been tried for a crime?"
When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked him: "What are you doing? That man is a Roman citizen!"
The commander went to Paul and asked him: "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," answered Paul.
The commander said: "I became one by paying a large amount of money." "I am one by birth," Paul answered.
At once the men who were going to question Paul drew back from him. The commander was frightened when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains.
The commander wanted to find out for sure what the Jews were accusing Paul of. The next day he had Paul’s chains taken off and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council to meet. Then he took Paul and made him stand before them.
Paul looked straight at the Council and said: "Fellow Israelites! My conscience is perfectly clear about the way in which I have lived before God to this very day."
The high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
Paul said to him: "God will strike you, white washed wall! Do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be struck?"
Those who stood near him said, "Do you revile the high priest of God?"
Then Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest. It is written: You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people."
When Paul saw that part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin: "Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of the dead."
When he said this dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The crowd was divided.
The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit. The Pharisees believe both.
There arose a great cry. The scribes who were on the Pharisees’ side arose and spoke, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
The dispute became so violent the commander was afraid they would pull Paul to pieces. He commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring him into the barracks.
The following night the Lord stood by him and said: "Be of good courage, Paul, for just as you testified about me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome."
When day arrived some of the Jews came together and united with an oath saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
There were more than forty involved in this conspiracy.
They went to the chief priests and elders and said: "We have united with a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
"Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, inform the commander that he bring him down to you tomorrow. You say you would inquire some more regarding him. We are ready to put him to death before he comes near."
Hearing about the ambush, Paul’s sister’s son entered the barracks and reported to Paul.
Paul called one of the centurions and said: "Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him."
The officer took him to the commander, and said: "The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to say to you."
The commander took him by the hand and led him off by himself, and asked: "What do you have to tell me?"
He said: "The Jewish authorities have agreed to ask you tomorrow to take Paul down to the Council. They want you to pretend the Council wants to get more accurate information about him.
"Do not give in to them. There are more than forty men lying in wait for him. They are united with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready and looking for a promise from you."
So the commander sent the young man away commanding, "Tell no one that you have told these things to me."
He called two centurions, saying, "Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea. Also prepare seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.
Provide some horses for Paul to ride and get him safely through to Governor Felix.
Then the commander wrote a letter that went like this:
The soldiers carried out their orders. That night they took Paul as far as Antipatris.
The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fort and left the horsemen to go on with him.
They took him to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor. Then they turned Paul over to him.
The governor read the letter and asked Paul what province he was from. When he found out that he was from Cilicia,
he said, "I will hear you fully when your accusers arrive." He commanded him to be kept in the praetorian of Herod.
After five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders. They brought an orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.
"We have seen peace under your rule. Excellent accomplishments have come to this nation due to your forethought. We acknowledge this with profound gratitude, most excellent Felix.
"That I not hinder you more, I request that you to hear us briefly in fairness.
"We have found this man to be a troublemaker who stirs up sedition resists lawful authority among all the Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
"He even tried to desecrate the temple. So we captured him according to our law.
"But the Roman commander Lysias came to us with the use of force and snatched him from our hands.
"He commanded his accusers to come to you. Examine him yourself and you will learn the truth about these charges we bring against him."
The Jews also joined in accusing him, saying that these things were true.
The governor motioned for Paul to speak. He said, "I know that you have been a judge for this nation for many years. For this reason I cheerfully make my defense.
You can easily verify that it was no more than twelve days ago that I went to worship in Jerusalem.
"They did not find me in the Temple, in the synagogues nor in the city disputing with any man. Neither did I cause a riot with the people.
"Neither can they prove the things for which they now accuse me.
"This I confess to you that according to The Way, which they call a sect, I serve the God of our fathers. I believe all the things written in the law and the prophets.
"I have hope toward God, which they also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.
"I exercise myself always, to have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.
"Now after many years I came to bring offerings and gifts of mercy to my nation.
"Some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple. There was neither crowd nor disturbance!
"They should have been here before you to testify against me.
"Or let the men here say what wrong they found in me while I stood before the Sanhedrin.
"Except for one utterance I cried out while standing among them. It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am called in question by you this day."
When Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them saying, "When Lysias the commander comes here I will decide your case."
He commanded a centurion to keep Paul. Allow him some freedom of custody and that some of his people should come and minister to him.
A few days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him concerning faith in Christ.
He reasoned about righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come. Felix trembled, and answered: "Go your way for now. When I have time I will send for you."
He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. He sent for him frequently and conversed with him.
After two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. Felix was willing to show the Jews a favor. He left Paul in prison.
Three days after arriving in the province Festus ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
The high priest and Jewish leaders brought charges against Paul.
They desired favor against him that he would transfer him to Jerusalem. Then they would ambush him along the way and kill him.
But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he would go there shortly.
He said: "Let those who have authority among you go there with me to present your case against this man if there is anything out of the way about the man."
After he stayed there more than ten days, he went to Caesarea. The next day he sat in judgment. He commanded Paul be brought before him.
When he arrived the Jews who also came there from Jerusalem presented many grievous complaints against Paul. They could not prove them.
Paul defended himself: "Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I committed any sin."
Festus was willing to do the Jews a favor, so he answered Paul: "Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
"I stand at Caesar’s court," Paul replied, "where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you are finding out.
"If I am a wrongdoer, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if charges brought against me by the Jews are not true no man has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."
Then Festus conferred with his council and answered: "Have you appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go."
A few days later king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.
While they were there Festus declared Paul’s cause to the king. He said, "There is a man that Felix left a prisoner.
"When I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him. They desire to have judgment against him.
"I told them it is not the Roman practice to deliver any man to die before his accusers face him. He should answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
"When they came before me, without any delay I sat in judgment, and commanded the man to be brought in.
"When the accusers took the stand they produced no charge of the wicked things I supposed about him.
"They had questions against him about their own superstition. They had one about Jesus, who is dead, but Paul affirmed to be alive.
"Since I doubt such manner of questions, I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem to be judged there of these matters.
"Paul appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus. So I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar."
Then Agrippa said to Festus: "I would also hear the man myself." Festus replied: "Tomorrow, you will hear him."
The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great elegance. They entered the place of hearing with the commanders and important men of the city. Festus gave the order for Paul to be brought in.
Festus said, "King Agrippa and all men who are present with us, you see this man, about whom all the crowds of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he should not live any longer.
"I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death. He has appealed to Augustus and I have determined to send him.
"I have no certain thing to write to my lord. I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination I might have something to write.
"It seems unreasonable to send a prisoner and not signify the crimes charged against him."
Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his arm and began his defense,
"I would be happy, King Agrippa, to answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which the Jews accuse me.
"I know you are an expert in all customs and controversy among the Jews. Therefore I urge you to hear me patiently.
"All the Jews know the way I first lived as a youth among my own nation at Jerusalem.
"They knew me from the beginning. They could testify that I was from the strictest sect of our religion and I lived as a Pharisee.
"Now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.
"Our twelve tribes served God day and night with the promise and hope of what was to come. It is because of this hope that the Jews accuse me, King Agrippa.
"Why should it be an incredible thought to you that God should raise the dead?
"I was convinced that I should oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
"That I did in Jerusalem. I locked up many of the holy ones in prison. I received authority from the chief priests and gave the command to put them to death.
"I punished them in every synagogue and tried to force them to recant their beliefs. I was exceedingly mad against them. I persecuted them even in strange cities.
"I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests.
"At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven. It was brighter than the sun and shinned all around me. It also shinned around those who journeyed with me.
"We all fell to the ground. I heard a voice speaking to me. It said in the Hebrew tongue: ‘ Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads. ’ ’ You only hurt yourself.
"I said: ‘ Who are you, Lord? ’ ’ And he answered: ‘ I am Jesus whom you persecute.
"Stand up on your feet. I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things that you have seen, and of those things I will show to you.
"I will rescue you from the people and the nations. I am sending you to them.
"To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. They may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me. ’
"You see, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
"I preached first to Damascus, and to Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the people of the nations, that they should repent and turn to God, and prove their repentance by deeds.
"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.
« Having obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those that the prophets and Moses said should come.
"That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first to rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the nations."
While he was defending himself, Festus said with a loud voice: "Paul, you are beside yourself. Much learning has made you mad."
But he answered back: "I am not mad, most noble Festus. I speak the words of truth and soberness!
"For the king knows about these things. I speak freely to him for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For this was not done in a corner.
"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
Then Agrippa said to Paul: "In a short time you would persuade convince me to become a Christian."
Paul replied, "I pray to God, that you and also all that hear me this day were altogether such as I am, except for these bonds."
When he finished speaking, the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and all who sat with them.
As they left they talked between themselves, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of prison."
Then Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
When it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and other prisoners to a man named Julius, a centurion of the band of Augustus.
We entered a ship at Adramyttium and set sail. We intended to sail by the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica was with us.
The next day we landed at Sidon. Julius treated Paul in a kind way and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself.
When we set sail from there we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
When we sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy. He put us on it.
We sailed slowly for many days and had problems arriving off Cnidus. The wind did not allow us to hold our course. So we sailed to the downwind part of Crete near Salmone.
It was difficult to move along the coast. We came to a place called Fair Havens near the town of Lasea.
Much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous. Because the fast was over Paul admonished them,
"Men, I see that our voyage from here on will be dangerous. There will be great damage to the cargo and to the ship, and loss of life as well."
But the army officer was convinced by what the captain and the owner of the ship said, and not by what Paul said.
It was not a good harbor in which to spend the winter. Nearly everyone was in favor of putting out to sea and trying to reach Phoenix in order to spend the winter there. Phoenix is a harbor in Crete that faces southwest and northwest.
A gentle wind from the south began to blow. The men thought they could accomplish their plan. So they pulled up the anchor and sailed as close as possible along the coast of Crete.
Soon a very strong northeast wind blew down from the island.
It hit the ship and it was impossible to keep the ship headed into the wind. We gave up trying and let it be carried along by the wind.
We had shelter when we passed to the south of the little island of Cauda. There, with some difficulty we managed to make the ship’s boat secure.
They pulled it aboard and then fastened some ropes tight around the ship. They were afraid that they might run into the sandbanks quicksand off the coast of Libya, so they lowered the sail and allowed the ship be carried by the wind.
The violent storm continued. The next day they began to throw some of the ship’s cargo overboard.
The following day they threw part of the ship’s equipment overboard.
The sun and stars did not appear for many days. No small tempest pressed upon us. All hope of our being saved was taken away.
After they spent a long time without eating Paul stood up and said: "Sirs, you should listen to me. You should not have put out to sea from Crete to sustain this damage and loss.
"I urge you to be of good cheer for none of you will lose your life, only the ship.
"Last night an angel of the God of whom I serve stood beside me.
"He said, "Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caessar and God has graciously given you the lives of you and all who sail with you.
"Be of good cheer. I believe God. It will happen just as he spoke to me.
"But we must run aground on some island."
On the fourteenth night we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria. About midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.
They sounded and found twenty fathoms. After a little space they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.
Fearing they would be cast ashore on rocky ground they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.
The sailors were seeking to flee from the ship. They lowered the boat into the sea by pretending they were lowering some anchors from the bow.
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: "Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved."
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
At daybreak Paul encouraged all of them to eat some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue without food.
"I encourage you to take some food for this is for your safety. Not a hair will perish from the head of any of you."
After he said this he took some bread, gave thanks to God in the presence of all. He broke it and began to eat.
Then they were all cheerful and ate some food.
Together there were two hundred and seventy six persons on board.
When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.
When daylight came they saw no land. But they thought they saw a bay with a beach. They debated whether to drive the ship upon it.
They threw the anchors overboard and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
The ship stuck fast on a sandbar and ran aground. The bow struck fast and would not move. Then the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
The soldiers’ planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any from swimming away and escaping.
The centurion desired to save Paul so he kept them from doing what they planned. He commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard, and get to the land first.
The rest were to use planks or something from the ship. So they all escaped safe to the land.
When we made it to shore safely we learned that the island was called Malta.
The natives there were very friendly to us. It started to rain and was cold, so they built a fire and made us all welcome.
Paul gathered an armful of sticks and put them on the fire. A snake came out on account of the heat and fastened itself to his hand.
The natives saw the snake hanging on Paul’s hand and said to one another: "This man must be a murderer, but Fate will not let him live, even though he escaped from the sea."
But Paul shook the snake off into the fire without being harmed at all.
The people were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. They waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him. They changed their minds and said he was a god.
A man named Publius, who was the governor of the island, had property around the area. He welcomed us and treated us kindly. We were his guests for three days.
His father was sick in bed. He suffered from fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, placed his hands on him, and made him well.
After that happened, other sick people on the island went to Paul and were made well.
They honored us with many gifts. When we were going to set sail, they put whatever we needed on board.
After three months we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that wintered at the island. The ship had the gods Castor and Pollux carved on its front.
We stopped at the city of Syracuse and stayed there three days.
We sailed from Syracuse and arrived at the city of Rhegium. The next day a south wind began to blow, and two days later we arrived at the city of Puteoli.
We came across some of the brothers, who kept us with them for seven days; and so we arrived at Rome.
When the brothers had news for us they came out from town as far as Appius Forum Market place on the Appian Road and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us. Paul saw them and praised God. He was encouraged.
When we arrived at Rome they allowed Paul to have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him.
Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews. When they assembled, he said to them: "My brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
"They questioned me and were ready to set me free, for they found me not guilty of any crime deserving death.
"When the Jews brought charges against me again I presented my cause to Caesar for I said nothing against my nation.
The reason I sent for you is to talk with you. I am in these chains because of the hope of Israel."
They said to him: "We have not had letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers have come to us to give an account or say any evil about you.
"We desire to hear your opinion concerning this sect. We have knowledge that it is attacked in all places."
So they set a date with Paul. A large number of them came that day to the place where Paul was staying. From morning till night he explained his message about the Kingdom of God to them. He tried to convince them about Jesus by quoting from the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets.
Some of them were convinced by his words, but others did not believe.
So they left, disagreeing among themselves, after Paul had said this one thing: "How well the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors!"
He said, "Go and say to this people, ‘ You will listen and listen, but not understand. You will look and look, but not see.
‘ "These people have closed their mind and are hard of hearing. They have shut their eyes so that their eyes never see. Their ears never hear. Their minds never understand. They never turn to me for healing. ’
"You need to know that God has sent his salvation to people who are not Jews. They will listen."
After he said this the Jews left arguing among themselves.
Paul rented a place to live for two full years and welcomed everyone who came to him.
He spread the message about God’s Kingdom and taught boldly about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one stopped him!
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, appointed set apart for the good news of God,
He promised this long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures.
This is about his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who came from the seed of David according to the flesh.
He was declared to be the Son of God with power through the Spirit of Holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Through whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, respecting his name.
You are among those called to Jesus Christ.
To all who are in Rome, beloved of God and called to be holy ones: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First, I thank my God for all of you through Jesus Christ, for your faith is reported throughout the whole world.
God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit whole heart and mind in the good news of his Son. Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.
I pray that I might by the will of God successfully come to you.
I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be strengthened,
that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.
I want you to know, brothers, that I was often determined to come to you, but was hindered until now, that I might have some fruit among you as well as the rest of the nations.
I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians, both to the wise, and to the unwise.
I am ready to preach the good news to you in Rome also.
I am not ashamed of the good news; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who exerts active faith believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
It reveals the righteousness of God from faith-to-faith for it is written: "The righteous shall live by faith."
The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
That which is known about God is clear to them, for God revealed it to them.
His invisible attributes are clearly seen since the creation of the world. The things made prove His eternal power and divine nature. Mankind has no excuse,
for when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God. They did not thank him and were vain in their reasoning, for their foolish hearts were darkened.
Claiming to be wise, they became fools.
They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
God gave them up to uncleanness because of the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.
They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creation more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
For this cause God gave them up to vile affections for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.
Also the men left the natural use of the woman and burned in their lust, one toward another; men with men working that which is obscene. They receive full recompense due for their error.
They did not like to retain God in their knowledge, so God gave them over to a reprobate depraved mind, to do things that are not fitting.
They are filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil mindedness; they are whisperers,
backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, and unmerciful.
They know the judgment of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death! And yet, they not only do the same, but also approve of those who do them.
You who judge have no excuse. For when you judge another you condemn yourself. After all you do the same things.
We are sure that the judgment of God, according to truth, is against those who commit such things.
What do you reason O man? When you judge these things, and you also do them, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?
Do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering? Do you not know that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
Thanks to your stubborn and unrepentant heart, you store up wrath for yourself, in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
He will render to each according to his works.
Those who are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will receive wrath and indignation.
God is not partial! God does not play favorites!
For all who have sinned without law will perish without law. All who have sinned under law will be judged under law.
The hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be righteous.
When those of the nations, who have no law, practice by nature the things of the law they are a law to themselves even though they do not have any law.
They show the work of the law written in their hearts. Their conscience also bears witness, and their thoughts accuse or excuse them.
This is in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, by Jesus Christ.
If you are a Jew in name and are resting on the law and taking glory in God,
you know his will. You approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.
And you have confidence that you are a leader of the blind, a light to those in darkness.
You are an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.
You then who teach another, do you teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?
You who say man should not commit adultery do you commit adultery? You who abhors idols do you rob temples?
You who boast in the law do you by transgression of the law dishonor God?
The name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, just as it is written.
Circumcision is a benefit if you obey the law. But if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
If therefore someone not circumcised obeys the requirements of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be considered circumcision?
The uncircumcised person is by nature, fulfilling the law. He will judge you because you transgress the law with your written code and circumcision.
He is not a Jew who is one on the outside. Neither is circumcision that which is on the outside in the flesh.
But he is a Jew who is so on the inside with circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
What then is the superiority of the Jew? What is the benefit of circumcision?
Much in every way. First they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
For what? If some have not believed, will their unbelief make the faith of God of no effect?
Certainly not! But let God be true, and every man false. It is written: So that you should be proved righteous in your words and should overcome when you are judged.
If our unrighteousness defines God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his anger is he? I speak in human terms.
Not at all! For how will God judge the world?
But what if my untruth serves God’s glory by making his truth stand out more clearly? Why should I be condemned as a sinner?
Why not say, "Let us do evil so that good may come?" Some people have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing! They should be condemned and they will be.
Are we Jews in any better condition than the people of the nations? Not at all! I have already shown that Jews and the people of the nations are all under the power of sin.
The Scriptures say: "There is no one who is righteous,
"There is no one who has insight. No one seeks God!
"All have turned away from God; they have all done wrong. No one does what is right, not even one."
"Their throat is an open grave. They have practiced deceit with their tongues. The poison of snakes is under their lips."
"Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."
"Their feet are swift to shed blood."
"Destruction and misery are in their ways."
"They have not known the way of peace."
There is no respect reverence for God before their eyes.
We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law. Every mouth may be stopped and the entire world may become liable to God for punishment.
No flesh will be justified before God by works of the law. Knowledge of sin comes from the law.
But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.
God makes people righteous through their active faith in Jesus Christ. God does this to all who believe in Christ, because there is no difference at all.
For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God
being justified freely by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
God displayed Christ publicly as propitiation atonement by his blood through faith. It demonstrated his righteousness. It was through the forbearance of God that he passed by the sins that had taken place before.
It showed his righteousness at this present season that he might himself be righteous, and the justifier of he who has faith in Jesus.
Where is the boasting? It is excluded. Is it by law? Is it by works? No, it is by a principle of faith.
We reason therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the nations also? Yes, of the nations also.
If God is one he will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.
Do we nullify the law through faith? No we do not! In fact, we establish continue stand by uphold the law.
What shall we say about Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?
If Abraham was declared righteous by works, he could boast, but not to God.
For what does the scriptures say? "Abraham believed Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness."
The pay is counted to the man who works. It is not as grace but as a debt.
He who does not work but believes in him who justifies absolves the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
David also pronounces blessing on the man, to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,
saying: "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
"Blessed is the man to whom, Jehovah will not impute sin."
Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say: "To Abraham his faith was counted for righteousness."
How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:
He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was not circumcised. That way he could be the father of all those who believe, though they are not circumcised, that righteousness might be counted to them.
The father of circumcision to those who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of faith of our father Abraham that he had when he was not circumcised.
The promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world was not through the law but through righteousness by faith.
If those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.
The law produces wrath violent passion indignation. But where there is no law there is no sin.
For this reason it is by faith that it may be according to grace divine influence loving-kindness. The promise may be sure to all descendants! This is not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is by the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
It is written: "I have made you a father of many nations." This was in the presence of God, the one in whom he believed. He gives life to the dead, and calls into being that which does not exist.
In hope against hope Abraham believed that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken: "So your descendants will be."
Not being weak in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead he being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.
Yet, he looked to the promise of God. He did not waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith. He gave the glory to God!
He was fully assured that what he had promised, he was able to perform.
"It was counted to him as righteousness."
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was counted to him.
It is also for our sake, to whom it shall be counted, who believe in him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification acquittal.
We are justified acquitted made righteous by faith. And we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
We have access to grace God’s favor by faith through him. This is where we stand. We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
Not only that, but we also rejoice in our tribulations knowing that tribulation produces endurance.
Tribulation produces an approved condition and an approved condition produces hope.
Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts. It comes through Holy Spirit, which is God’s gift to us.
While we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die. Perhaps for the good man some one would even dare to die.
But God demonstrates commends his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more, now justified by his blood, we will be saved from the wrath of God through him.
While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son. Being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.
We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation restoration atonement divine favor.
Therefore, through one-man sin entered into the world, and death through sin. So death passed to all men, for all have sinned.
Until the law sin was in the world. Sin is not imputed put on account when there is no law.
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even for those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression. Adam is in some ways like Christ who came later.
But the two are not the same, because God’s gift spiritual endowment is not like Adam’s sin. It is true that many people died because of the sin of that one man. But God’s grace is much greater, and so is his gift to so many people through the loving-kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ.
And there is a difference between God’s gift spiritual endowment and the sin of one man. After the one sin, came the guilty judgment; but after so many sins, comes the undeserved gift of righteousness.
It was by the transgression of the one that death ruled as king through that one. Even more so shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, rule as kings in life by the one, Jesus Christ.
The result of one trespass was condemnation for all men. The result of righteousness was justification acquittal, which brings life for all men.
Through the disobedience of one man many have been made sinners. Yet through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.
The law came that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased God’s loving kindness increased even more.
And what for? Just as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
God forbid. We died to sin! How could we any longer live in it?
Or are you ignorant to the fact that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death. Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, that we might walk in the newness of life.
If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be in the likeness of his resurrection.
We know this that our old self was impaled with him that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should no longer be in bondage to sin.
He who has died is freed from sin.
If we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.
We know that Christ being raised from the dead died no more; death no longer has dominion over him.
For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin once. But the life that he lives, he lives to God.
Consider yourselves to be dead with reference to sin, but alive with reference to God through Christ Jesus.
Let no sin rule in your mortal body, that you should obey the lustful desires.
Also do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness for God.
Sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.
What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid!
Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient servants you are his voluntary servants because you obey him? This could be obedience to sin with death in view or obedience to righteousness with holiness in view?
But thanks to God, that you were the servants of sin yet you became obedient from the heart to the teachings delivered to you.
After being made free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.
I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. You once presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to sin. Now you present your members as servants to righteousness and sanctification purification holiness.
When you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
You are now ashamed of the fruit you had at that time. For the results of these things is death.
Now you are free from sin and are servants to God. You have your fruit in holiness, and the end everlasting eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift from God is everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Do you not know, for I speak to men who know the law, that the law has dominion jurisdiction over a man as long as he lives?
Law binds the married woman to her husband while he lives. But if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress. If the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
Brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ; that you should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.
When we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.
We have been discharged released from the law. We have died to that by which we were held. So we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid! I had not known sin except through the law. For I had not known coveting except the law had said: You should not covet.
But sin, finding occasion, worked out in me through the commandment all manner of coveting. Apart from the law sin is dead.
I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
The commandment, which was to life, this I found to be to death.
For sin, finding occasion, through the commandment deceived me, and through it killed me.
The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
Did that which is good become death to me? God forbid! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good. This way sin might be shown to be sin. Through the commandment sin could be recognized.
For we know that the law is spiritual. But I am fleshly and sold under sin.
I do not understand what I am doing. For what I want to do I do not do. What I hate, I do.
But if what I do not want to do, I do, I consent to the law that it is right.
Now then it is no longer I that do it, but the sin that dwells in me.
I know that good does not live in my human nature. For even though the desire to do good is in me, I am not able to do it.
I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I do the evil that I do not want to do.
If I do what I do not want to do, this means that I am no longer the one who does it. Instead, it is the sin that lives in me.
I find that this law is at work. When I want to do what is good, what is evil is the only choice I have.
My inner person delights in the law of God.
However I see a different law at work in my body. This law fights against the law that my mind approves of. It makes me a prisoner to the law of sin that is at work in my body.
Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?
Thanks to God, through our Lord Jesus Christ! So then I can serve God’s law only with my mind, while my human nature serves the law of sin.
Those who live through in union with because of Jesus Christ have no condemnation. They do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
The law of the Spirit gives us life through with because of Christ Jesus. It has set me free from the law of sin and death.
God did what the Law could not do, because human nature was weak. He sent his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering and do away with sin. So he condemned sin in sinful human nature.
God did this so that the righteous requirements of the Law might be fully satisfied in us who live according to the Spirit, and not according to human nature.
They who live according to flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh. They who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
The mind of sinful flesh fleshly thought means death; but the mind influenced by the Spirit gives life and peace.
This is because the mind of the flesh is hostile toward God. It is not subject to the law of God for it cannot be.
Those influenced by the sinful flesh cannot please God.
But you are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God’s Spirit dwells in you. If any one does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.
If Christ is with you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit is life on account of righteousness.
If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from among the dead dwells with you, he who raised Christ from among the dead shall also make your mortal bodies alive. This is on account of his Spirit that dwells with you.
So then, brothers we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh human nature,
for if you live according to flesh, you are about to die. If by the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
For you have not received a spirit of bondage again causing fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Father, Father! Chaldee: Abba, meaning father.
The Spirit itself Greek: autos ho pneuma itself the Spirit bears witness with our spirit mind and heart, that we are children of God.
If children, then heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. If indeed we suffer with him we may also be glorified with him.
I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us.
For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation revelation disclosure of the sons of God.
For the creation was subject to corruption, not by it’s own will but by reason of the one who subjected it on the basis of hope.
The creation will also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation groans and is in pain together until now.
We also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption and the release from our bodies by ransom.
We are saved by this hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For does a man hope for what he sees?
If we hope for what we do not see, do we have patience to wait for it?
Likewise the Spirit also helps our weaknesses. We do not know what we should pray for, as we should. The Spirit of God makes intercession with groaning that cannot be spoken.
So he who searches the hearts knows what is the inclination purpose mind-set of the Spirit of God, because the Spirit makes intercession for the holy ones according to the will of God.
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
Those he first recognized, he ordained in advance that they be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
He ordained in advance the ones he called. He declared righteous the ones he called. He also glorified those he declared righteous.
What shall we then say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
He that did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things?
Who will bring any charge against the ones God has chosen? It is God who justifies makes righteous.
Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
It is written: "For your sake we are put to death all day long. We are considered as sheep for the slaughter."
In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
I tell the truth in Christ. I do not lie! My conscience bears witness with me in Holy Spirit.
I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart.
I could wish that I were accursed separated banned excommunicated from Christ for the good of in behalf of my countrymen and brothers the Jews.
They are Israelites and the adoption belongs to them. They have the glory of the covenants. The law was given to them along with the service and promises.
The forefathers belong to them from whom came the Christ according to the flesh. God who is over all is blessed forever. Amen.
It is not as if the word of God failed. Not all who come from Israel are really Israel.
It is not because they are Abraham’s that they are all children, but: "What will be called ‘ your seed ’ ’ will be through Isaac."
That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as seed.
The word of promise: "According to this time I will come and Sarah will have a son."
Not only that, but Rebecca conceived by Isaac our father.
When they had not yet been born nor performed anything good or vile, so the purpose of God regarding the choosing would continue without dependence on works but on the One who calls.
She was told: "The older will serve the younger."
It is written: "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau."
What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? There is not!
He says to Moses, "I will show mercy to the one I choose to show mercy, and I will feel compassion for the one I choose to feel compassion."
So then it does not depend on mans will or effort, but on God who shows mercy.
The scripture says to Pharaoh: "For this reason I have raised you up, that I might through you, show my power and declare my name in all the earth."
He shows mercy to the one he chooses, and he allows others to be stubborn.
You say to me: "Why does he yet find fault? Who resists his purpose will?"
Yes, but you, O man, who are you to answer back to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: "Why have you made me this way?"
Or does the potter not have authority over the clay? Can he make out of the same lump one vessel to honor, and another for common use?
If God decided to show his wrath and make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fit for destruction.
In that way he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he had prepared in advance for glory.
We are the ones he has also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the nations.
He says also in Hosea: "Those who are not my people I will call my people. And she who is not loved I will call loved."
In the place where it was said to them: "You are not my people, they will be called Sons of the living God."
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.
"He is bringing the matter to an end, and cutting it short in righteousness. Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth."
Just as Isaiah said earlier: "Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left a seed to us, we should have become like Sodom, and Gomorrah."
What shall we say? The nations did not pursue righteousness. Yet they have attained to righteousness, the righteousness that is based on the principle of faith.
But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to that law.
Why? It is because it was not based on the principle of faith, but on that of works. They have stumbled at the stumbling stone.
It is written: "Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence and he that believes on him will not be ashamed."
Brothers, my hearts desire and my prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation.
I testify that they have zeal for God, but not according to precise and correct knowledge.
They are ignorant of God’s righteousness. They seek to establish their own righteousness and have not submitted to the righteousness of God.
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who exerts active faith.
Moses writes down the righteousness that is of the law. The man who has practiced those things shall live by them.
But the righteousness of faith speaks this way: "Do not say in your heart: ‘ who will ascend to heaven? That is, to bring Christ down;
or "‘ who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring up Christ from among the dead. ’"
But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart." It is the "word" of faith, which we preach.
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and have active faith in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
For with the heart one believes for righteousness. And with the mouth one declares for salvation.
The scripture says: "No one believing on him shall be disappointed."
For there is no difference between Jew and Greek. The same Lord God of all is abounding in riches for all who call on him.
"Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved."
How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without someone to preach?
How will they preach unless they have been sent? Just as it is written: "How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace and who bring good tidings of good things! For they proclaim salvation and say to Zion: "Your God reigns as king!" Hebrew: Elohiym ’ ’ malak ’: God rules!
But they have not all obeyed the good news. For Isaiah says: "Jehovah, who has believed our message?"
So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word about Christ.
I say: Have they not heard? Yes in fact their sound went "into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the inhabited earth."
I say Israel did not know. First Moses said: "I will provoke you people to rivalry through that which is not a nation, and I will anger you with a foolish nation."
Isaiah is very bold, and says: "Those who did not seek me found me. I was made manifest to those who did not ask for me."
But to Israel he says: "All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who are disobedient and self-willed obstinate."
I ask has God rejected his people? Certainly not! I also am an Israelite, a descendant of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
God has not rejected his people whom he first knew. Do you remember what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he made intercession to God against Israel?
"Jehovah, they have killed your prophets, and torn down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life."
What does God say in answer to him? "I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."
Even so at this present time there is a remnant chosen according to God’s grace.
If it is by grace then it is no longer on the basis of works. Otherwise grace is not grace undeserved kindness. But if it is of works then it is not by grace. Otherwise works are no longer works.
What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks. The chosen ones have obtained it, and the rest were blinded rendered stupid hardened made insensitive.
It is written, "God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear to this very day."
David says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and recompense to them.
"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always."
I ask: Did they stumble and fall? Certainly not! But rather through their fall into sin salvation has come to the nations. This will provoke them to jealousy.
Now if their fall into sin means riches to the world, and their decrease means riches of the nations how much more will their full number mean?
I speak to you people of the nations. For I am the apostle to the nations and I glorify honor praise celebrate my ministry.
If by any means I may provoke those who are of my flesh fellow countrymen, and might save some of them.
If their rejection means reconciliation for the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
If the first piece is holy, the lump is also holy. If the root is holy, so are the branches.
Some of the branches are broken off. You, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them. Therefore you partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree with them.
Do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, you do not support the root, but the root supports you.
You will say, "The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."
They were broken off because of unbelief! You stand by faith! Do not be conceited but be reverent.
God did not spare the natural branches and he will not spare you!
Observe both God’s kindness and severity. Severity is for those who fail to continue. But kindness is for you as long as you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you will be cut off.
If they do not continue in unbelief they will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.
If you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a garden olive tree: how much more could these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
I do not want you to be ignorant of this secret, lest you should be wise in your own conceits estimation. Blindness has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations comes in.
In this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: The deliverer will come out of Zion and will remove ungodliness from Jacob.
For this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.
Concerning the good news, they are enemies for your sakes. With reference to the chosen ones, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.
In times past you have not believed did not obey God. Yet you have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
Even so these also do not believe now. Through the mercy shown they also may obtain mercy.
For God has stopped all disobedience so he might show mercy to all.
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments. His ways are beyond human understanding!
For who has known the mind of Jehovah? Or who has been his counselor?
Or who has first given to him, that it shall be repaid to him again?
For from him, and through him, and to him are all things: Glory to him forever! Amen.
I request urge implore you brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.
Do not be conformed to this world religious, social, political, and economic arrangement. But be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Prove what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.
I say through the grace given to me that every man among you should not think more highly of himself than he ought to think. But to think soberly, just as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.
For we have many members in one body and all members do not have the same function.
These many members are one body in Christ, and every one, individually, is a member one of the other.
We have gifts that differ according to the grace that is given to us. Whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he who teaches on teaching;
or he who exhorts; on exhortation; he who gives let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor evil and cling to good.
Be devoted to one another with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another.
Do not lag behind in diligence. Be fervent in spirit serving God.
Rejoice in hope! Be patient in tribulation. Continue in prayer.
Contribute to the needs of the holy ones and practice hospitality.
Bless those who persecute you. Bless and do not curse.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
Be of the same mind as others. Do not think lofty things but be led along by lowly things. Do not be wise in your own conceit self-love vanity estimation.
Return evil for evil to no man. Provide honest things in the sight of all men.
When it is possible, be peaceable with all men.
Dearly beloved, do not avenge yourselves, instead leave room for divine punishment, for it is written: Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.
Therefore if your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he thirsts, give him drink. For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.
Do not be evil, but overcome evil with good.
Let every person be subject to superior authorities. For there is no authority except by God. God allows the authorities to serve in their positions.
Whoever opposes the authority resists the ordinance of God. Those who resist will receive judgment.
For rulers are objects of fear, not to good works, but to the evil. Will you not have respect for the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it.
He is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.
You must be in subjection, not only because of that wrath, but also for the sake of your conscience.
That is why you pay taxes. They are God’s ministers continually serving this very purpose.
Render therefore to all their due. Provide tribute to whom tribute is due. Give custom to whom custom is owed. Render fear to whom fear is owed and offer honor to whom honor is deserved.
Owe no man any thing but to love one another. He that loves another has fulfilled obeyed the law.
For the Law code says: You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not bear false witness, and you must not covet. If there is any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying; namely, you must love your neighbor as yourself.
Love works no ill to his neighbor. Therefore love is the law’s fulfillment.
You know the time. It is the hour for you to awake from sleep. Now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers.
The night is far along and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Let us walk honestly as in the daytime, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and loose conduct, not in strife and jealousy.
Put on live like clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh.
Accept the man who has a weak faith, but not to entertain doubtful thinking.
For one believes that he may eat all things. Another who is weak eats only vegetables.
Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating. Let the one who does not eat judge him that eats, for God has received him.
Who are you to judge another man’s servant? He stands or falls before his own master. Yes, he will be made to stand for God can make him stand.
One person judges one day above another. Another person judges every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
He who regards the day regards it to God and he who does not regard the day does not regard it to God. He, who eats, eats to God, for he gives God thanks. He who does not eat does not eat to God and he gives God thanks.
For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.
For if we live, we live to God and if we die, we die to God. Therefore should we live or die, we are God’s.
To this end Christ both died, and rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.
Why do you judge your brother? Why do you look down on your brother with contempt? We will all stand before the judgment seat of God Theos.
It is written: As I live, says Jehovah, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will acknowledge confess to Jehovah.
So then every one of us will give account of himself to God.
Let us not judge one another any more. Let no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean in itself. If someone thinks something is unclean it is unclean to him.
If because of your food your brother is grieved, you do not walk in love. Do not allow what you eat to destroy the one for whom Christ died.
Do not let the good you do be spoken of as evil.
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For he that serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of by men.
Let us follow after the things that make for peace, and things that are encouraging to one another.
Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.
It is good neither to eat food, nor to drink wine, nor any thing that causes your brother to stumble or be offended and weakened.
Do you have faith? Have it for yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing that he allows.
He that doubts is damned if he eats, because he eats not by faith. Whatever is not by faith is sin!
We who are strong in the faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens. We should not just please ourselves.
Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up.
For even Christ did not please himself. However it is written, "The reproaches insults hurled at you have fallen on me."
The things written in earlier times were written for our instruction, that we through endurance and the encouragement from the Scriptures might have hope.
Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.
To this end you may glorify God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mind and one accord language united expression.
Receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcised for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers.
That the nations might glorify God for his mercy as it is written: "For this cause I will confess you to the people of the nations, and sing to your name."
And again he says: "Rejoice, you nations, with his people."
And again: "Praise Jehovah, all you nations; and laud him, all you people."
And again, Isaiah says: "Then in that day the nations will search for and turn to the root of Jesse. He will stand as a signal for the peoples. His resting place will be glorious."
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.
I am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Nevertheless, brothers, I have written more boldly to you on some points, keeping you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God,
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the good news of God, that the offering of these nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
I glory in Jesus Christ in my service to God.
I will not dare to speak of any of those things that Christ has not accomplished through me. I will lead the nations to obey God in word and deed.
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God. From Jerusalem, and round about Illyricum, I have fully preached the good news of Christ.
I have strived to preach the good news, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:
It is written, "To whom he was not announced, they shall see: and those who have not heard shall understand."
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
I have no more places to go in these parts, and have a great desire these many years to come to you.
When I take my journey to Spain, I will come to you. I trust to see you in my journey, and to be escorted on my way by you, after I have been satisfied with your company.
Now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones.
It pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor holy ones in Jerusalem.
It pleased them to do so and they are debtors for this. If the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in physical things.
After I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come to you in Spain.
I am sure that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good news of Christ.
Now I beg you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me.
That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted by the holy ones.
That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a minister of the congregation at Cenchrea.
Receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the holy ones. Assist her in whatever business she has need of from you. She has been a great help to many people including me.
Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus.
They have risked their own necks for my life. I not only thank them but also the congregations of the nations give thanks.
Likewise greet the congregation that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is of the first fruits converts of Asia to Christ.
Greet Mary for she labored much to help us.
Greet Andronicus and Junia. They are my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners who are well known among the apostles. They were in Christ before me.
Greet Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
Greet Urbane for he is our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them that are of Aristobulus’ household.
Greet my relative Herodion. Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus, for they are in the Lord.
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord.
Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers that are with them.
Greet Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. The congregations of Christ greet you.
Now I beseech you, brothers, mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine you have learned and avoid them.
They do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the unaware.
Your obedience has come to our attention abroad. I am glad therefore on your behalf. Yet I would have you wise to that which is good and simple concerning evil.
The God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Timothy my coworker and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my relative, salute you.
I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.
Gaius my host and the whole congregation, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my good news, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the secret, which was kept secret since the world began.
It is now made known by the Scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God. It is made known to all nations for the obedience of faith.
To God, wise alone, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
This letter is from Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother.
To the congregation of God at Corinth. To you, who are sanctified in Christ Jesus. You who are called to be holy ones, with all whom in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. He is both their Lord and ours.
Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus Christ.
He enriches you in every way, in all speaking, and in all knowledge.
The testimony of Christ was confirmed verified established in you.
You do not lack spiritual gifts as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He will also confirm establish you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there are no divisions among you. You should be perfectly joined together united in the same mind and thought.
The house of Chloe told me, my brothers, that there are disputes among you.
Concerning that I say, that each one of you said, "I follow Paul;" and "I follow Apollos;" and "I follow Cephas;" and "I follow Christ."
Is Christ divided? Was Paul impaled for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius.
So no one should say that I baptized in my own name.
I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides that I do not know whether I baptized any others.
Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the good news: not with wisdom of words, lest the stake of Christ be emptied of its effect.
For the preaching of the stake is foolishness to those who perish. It is the power of God to us who are saved.
It is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
This is the wisdom of God that the world through its wisdom did not come to know God. God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.
Indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom.
We preach Christ impaled. It is a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the nations!
To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, it is Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
For the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
Consider your calling, brothers. Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.
Instead God chose the foolish things of the world to confuse shame the wise. God chose the weak things of the world to confuse shame the things that are mighty.
God also chose the base things of the world, and things which are despised, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are.
No human being should boast before God.
It is because of him you are united with Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
Let it be as it is written, "He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah!"
Brothers, I did not come to you with superiority of speech or with human wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
I decided not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and his death on the torture stake.
And I came to you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
My speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
that your faith should not exist in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
How is it we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, or of the rulers of this age, who come to nothing are doomed to destruction?
We speak the wisdom of God in a secret, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the ages generations and human entities for our glory.
None of the rulers of this age knew understood for had they known it they would not have impaled the glorious Lord esteemed Master.
It is written: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, and it has not entered into the heart of man, the things God prepared for those who love him."
But God revealed them to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit investigates searches all things, yes even the deep things of God.
For what man knows the things of a man, except the mental disposition that is in man? Even so no one knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God. This is so we might know the things that are freely given to us from God.
We speak these things, not in the words that man's wisdom teaches. But we speak them with the words the Holy Spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God. They are foolishness to him! He cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
He that is spiritual judges all things, yet no man judges him.
"Who has understood the mind of Jehovah, or has instructed him, as his counselor?" But we do have the mind purpose feelings thoughts understanding of Christ.
Brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as fleshly men, as babes infants in Christ.
I fed you milk and not solid food. You were not able to receive it. You are not able now!
You are still fleshly! There is envy, strife, and divisions among you. Do you not walk as ordinary men?
While one said, "I belong to Paul;" and another, "I belong to Apollos;" are you not fleshly human beings?
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
I have planted, Apollos watered; but God caused the growth.
Neither he that plants and neither he that waters is anything; but God gives the increase.
Now he who plants and he who waters are one in purpose and every man will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
For we are fellow workers together with God. You are God's field under cultivation. You are God's building.
According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let every man take heed how he builds.
No other foundation can be laid than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
Now if any man builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, and stubble;
every man's work will be made known, for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will prove what sort every man's work is.
If a man's work that he built upon lasts, he will receive a reward.
If a man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss: but he will be saved by fire.
Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
God will destroy any man who defiles the temple of God! For the temple of God is holy. You are that temple!
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. It is written: "He catches the wise in their own craftiness deception."
And again: "Jehovah knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain useless empty."
Therefore let no man boast in men. For all things are yours.
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours!
And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God.
People should regard us as servants of Christ. God has trusted us with his secrets.
It is required of stewards that a man is trustworthy.
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself.
I know nothing against myself. Yet this does not acquit me, but he that judges me is God.
Do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make apparent the counsels of the hearts. Then each man’s praise will come from God.
Brothers I have applied these things to myself and to Apollos for your sakes. That way you might learn the value of the saying: Do not go beyond the things written. None of you should be arrogant self-important against one another.
For who made you superior to different than another? What do you have that you did not receive? If you did receive it, why do you brag, as if you did not receive it?
You are full and now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us. I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
For I think that God has placed us apostles last as men appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.
We are fools for Christ. But you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honorable, but we are despised.
Even to this present hour we both hunger and thirst. We are naked. We are treated badly and we are homeless.
We labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
being slandered, we answer kindly. We are made as the filth of the world and are the refuse of all things to this day.
I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.
Though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news.
For this reason I urge you to imitate me.
I send Timothy, my beloved son faithful in the Lord, to you for this purpose. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ, just as I teach it in every congregation.
Now some have become proud arrogant, thinking that I would not come to you.
But I will come to you shortly, if God wills, and I will get to know what the proud ones do and not what they say, but their power.
For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
What do you want? Shall I come to you with punishment or with love, and in the mild spirit of meekness?
It is reported that there is sexual immorality among you. This type of fornication is not even found among the people of the nations who do not know God. There is a man who has his father’s wife.
And you are proud! You should have been filled with sadness that he did this deed. And you should have ejected expelled excommunicated disfellowshiped him from your congregation.
I am not there with you in person. But I am with you in spirit. I have already judged the man who did this.
When you assemble in the name and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, I will be with you in spirit.
Deliver this one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Do you know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough?
Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new batch of dough. For even Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us.
Therefore let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I wrote in a letter to you not to keep company with fornicators.
Yet you cannot completely avoid the fornicators of this world, nor the greedy persons, nor cheaters and robbers, nor those who worship idols. To do so you would have to leave this world.
I wrote you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother who is a fornicator, or who is greedy, or who worships idols, or constantly gets drunk, or cheats people. Do not even eat with such a person.
What have I to do with judging those outside in the world? Do we not judge those who are inside the congregation?
God judges those outside. Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.
If you have a dispute with another Christian do you dare to go to a law court before judges who are ungodly? Why not let the holy ones decide who is right?
Do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if you will judge the world, are you unworthy to judge these small matters?
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the matters that pertain to this life?
If you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, would you appoint as judges those who mean nothing to the congregation?
I speak to shame you. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? Not one who would be able to judge between his brothers?
But brother goes to court against brother, and this before unbelievers.
It is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not let yourself be wronged? Why not let your selves be defrauded cheated?
Instead you do wrong and defraud, and you do this to your brothers and sisters!
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor people who worship idols, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,
nor thieves, nor covetous greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, will inherit the kingdom of God.
That is what some of you were. You have been washed clean and now you are sanctified. The Spirit of our God declares you righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus.
All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient profitable good. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the authority power control of anything.
Foods are for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will destroy both of them. Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.
God has resurrected the Lord, and will also resurrect us by his own power.
Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and unite them with turn them into the members of a prostitute? God forbid!
What? Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one united with her body? For he said: "Two will be one flesh."
He who is joined to the Lord is one united with him in spirit.
Flee from fornication! Every sin that a man does is outside his body. But he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
What? Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? That one Greek: "hos he ho" which, that one is in you. You received it from God. You are not your own.
You are bought with a price! Therefore glorify God in your body.
Concerning the things that you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch have sex with a woman.
Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
Let the husband fulfill his marital duties to his wife and also the wife to her husband.
The wife has no authority over her own body, but her husband does. Likewise also the husband has no authority over his own body, but his wife does.
Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent for a time. That way you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. Then come together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
But I speak this by concession and not by commandment.
I prefer that all men were as I am. But every man has his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they stay unmarried like me.
But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. It is better to marry than to be inflamed with lust.
To the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord commands do not let the wife depart from her husband.
If she leaves, let her remain unmarried or become reconciled to her husband. A husband should not divorce his wife.
To the others, I speak and not the Lord. If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him he should not divorce her.
And the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is willing to live with her, she should not divorce him.
For the wife sanctifies the unbelieving husband, and the husband sanctifies the unbelieving wife. Otherwise your children would be unclean. But now they are holy.
If the unbelieving leave, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases for God has called us to peace.
Wife how do you know that you will save your husband? Husband how do you know whether you will save your wife?
But as God has distributed to every person so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the congregations.
Is any man called being circumcised? He should not become uncircumcised. Is any called who is not circumcised? He should not be circumcised.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. Obey the commandments of God.
Each man should remain in the same condition in which he was called.
Were you called being a slave? Do not let it worry you. But if you can become free, do so.
He who is called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord's freeman. Likewise also he who is called, being free, is Christ's slave.
You are bought with a price. Stop being slaves of men.
Brothers, let every man remain in the condition in which he was called. Abide with God.
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord. Yet I give my opinion as one who has obtained the mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
Because of the present distress I think it is good for you to remain as you are.
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek a release. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
If you marry you have not sinned. If a virgin marries she has not sinned. Those who marry will face many problems in this life and I want to spare you.
I will say this brothers the time remaining is short. So from now on those who have wives should be like those who have none.
Those who weep should be like those who do not weep. And those who rejoice should be like those who do not rejoice, and those who buy like those who do not possess.
Those who use this world should not abuse it, for the fashion of this world is passing away.
I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.
But he who is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. She who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
I say this for your benefit and not to restrict you. I show you how to live a noble life of devotion to the Lord without being distracted by other things.
If any man thinks he behaves improperly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, let him do what he will, he does not sin if they get married.
Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virginity he does well.
So then he who gives his virginity in marriage does well; but he who does not get married does even better.
The wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
But she is happier if she remains as she is. This is my opinion and I think I also have the Spirit of God.
Concerning things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
If any man thinks he knows any thing, he really knows nothing, according to what he ought to know.
But if any man loves God, God knows him.
Concerning the eating of food offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
There are those called gods in heaven or on earth. There are many gods and many lords.
But to us there is but one God, the Father. All things come from him and we live for him. And there is one Lord Jesus Christ. All things were made through him and we were made through him.
Not all people know this. Some eat food offered to idols and their conscience being weak is defiled.
But food will not recommend us to God. If we do not eat we are not worse. If we eat we are not better.
Be careful that this freedom does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
If any man with knowledge sees you having a meal from an idol’s temple, will the conscience of the weak one be emboldened encouraged to eat food offered to idols?
And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish. Christ died for him!
When you sin against your brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
If food makes my brother stumble I will eat no food at all so I do not make my brother stumble.
Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
If I am not an apostle to others, I most certainly am to you, for you are the seal stamp proof of my apostleship in the Lord.
My answer defense to those who examine me is as follows:
Do we have a right to eat and drink?
Do we have a right to lead a sister as a wife just like other apostles, and as brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have the right to refrain from secular work?
Does a soldier serve at his own expense? Does the one who plants a vineyard not eat of the fruit it produces? Who shepherds a flock and does not eat some of the milk from the flock?
I say this from a human point of view. Does the law say the same thing?
It is written in the Law of Moses: You should not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads threshes out the grain. Does God care only about oxen?
Or did he say it for our benefit? This is written for our benefit without a doubt! He who plows should plow in hope. Likewise he who threshes in hope should be a partaker of his hope.
If we sow spiritual seed in you, is it too much if we reap material things?
If others are partakers of the right over you, should we also partake? Nevertheless we have not used this power! We suffer all things, lest we should hinder the good news of Christ.
Do you not know that they who minister about holy things live off the things of the temple? And they who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
Even so, has the Lord ordained that they who preach the good news should earn their living from the good news?
But I have used none of these rights! Neither have I written these things, that it should be done to me. It would be better for me to die, than that any man should make my reason for boasting void.
Though I preach the good news I do not brag about it. Preaching the good news is my duty obligation and I must do it! It would be terrible if I did not preach the good news!
For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward. But if I do it against my will, I am just performing the trust of the good news committed to me.
What is my reward then? When I preach the good news, I may offer the good news of Christ without charge. That is way I do not abuse my power in the good news.
For, though I am free from all persons, yet I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain more.
To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews. To those under the Law, as under the Law, that I might gain those under the Law.
To those without Law I became like those without Law that I might gain them. I am not without law to God, but under the law to toward of Christ.
To the weak I became as the weak, that I might gain the weak. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
And this I do for the sake of the good news that I might be a partaker of it with others.
Do you not know that they who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain the prize.
Every man taking part in the contest is temperate in all things. They do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we do it to receive an incorruptible crown.
I do not run without definite aim purpose and I do not fight like a man beating the air.
But I discipline my body, and bring it into subjection, so that after I have preached to others I will not be disqualified.
Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant about how all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.
They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
They all ate the same spiritual meal.
They all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them. That Rock was represented symbolic of Christ!
God was not pleased with most of them. And their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
Now these things were examples for us. They teach us not to lust after evil things like they did.
Do not be idolaters like some of them. It is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.
Do not commit fornication like some of them committed. Twenty three thousand of them died in one day.
Do not test Jehovah like some of them also did and were destroyed by serpents.
Do not grumble like some of them grumbled. Venomous snakes killed them.
These things happened for examples, and they are written for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has come.
Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall.
No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man. God is faithful and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your limits. He will make a way out, that you will be able to endure it.
My dearly beloved, flee run away from idolatry.
I speak as to wise men. You judge what I say.
The cup of blessing we bless, is it not the sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread we break, is it not the sharing of the body of Christ?
For we being many are one-bread and one-body. We are all partakers of that one bread.
Is physical Israel the ones who eat the sacrifices, the partakers of the altar?
What do I mean? That the idol is anything, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything?
But I say, that the things that the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.
You cannot drink the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons. You cannot be partakers of the Jehovah's Table and of the table of demons.
Do we provoke Jehovah to rivalry indignation anger? Are we stronger than he?
All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient profitable. All things are lawful for me, but all things do not build up confirm strengthen.
Let no one seek his own advantage, but that of the other person.
Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without asking questions for the sake of conscience.
For the earth and that which fills it is Jehovah’s.
If a nonbeliever invites you to a feast and you feel you must go eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience sake.
But if any man says to you: "This is offered in sacrifice to idols," do not eat for the sake of the one who said it and for conscience sake.
Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: Yet why is my freedom judged by another man's conscience?
For if I by grace am a partaker, why is evil spoken about me concerning that for which I give thanks?
Whether you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to the glory of God.
Do not stumble or offend do not lead into sin, neither to the Jews, nor to the nations, nor to the congregation of God.
Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own good, but the good of many, that they may be saved.
Be followers imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
Now I praise you, brothers, because you remember me in all things, and carefully follow the teachings precepts doctrine just as I delivered them to you.
I would have you know, that the head authority of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
Every man who prays or prophesies having his head covered dishonors his head.
But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head. She is the same as if she had her head shaved.
For if the woman were not covered, let her also be shaved. But if it is a shame for a woman to have her head shaved, let her be covered.
For a man should not cover his head, for he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.
For the man is not from the woman; but the woman is from the man.
Neither was man created for woman but woman for man.
That is why the woman should have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels.
However in the Lord, both men and women exist together. Not one without the other.
For as woman is from man, even so is man also from woman. But all things are from God!
Judge in yourselves. Is it proper that women pray to God uncovered?
Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if men have long hair, it is a shame?
But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering.
If anyone is contentious about this we have no other practice, neither do the congregations of God.
Now in this that I declare to you that I do not praise you. For you come together not for the better but for the worse.
For first of all, when you come together in the congregation, I hear that there are divisions among you and I partly believe it.
For there must be also heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.
When you come together to one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.
For in eating every one goes ahead with out waiting for everybody else. One is hungry and another is drunk.
Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the congregation of God, and shame them that have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I will not praise you!
For I received from the Lord that which I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread.
And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take and eat. This represents is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
In the same manner, after supper, he took the cup, saying, "This cup represents is the new covenant of my blood. Drink this as often as you do it in remembrance of me."
For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till he comes.
Whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of sinning against falsely representing the body and blood of the Lord.
Let a man examine himself before he eats of that bread, and drinks of that cup.
For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning not judging rightly the Lord's body.
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
But when we are judged, Jehovah disciplines us, that we should not be destroyed condemned with the world.
When you come together to eat, wait for one another.
If any man is hungry let him eat at home. That way you come together without condemnation. I will give direction to care for other matters when I come.
Concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be without knowledge.
You know that you were of the nations, carried away and led by mute idols.
I want you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed. And no person can say, "Jesus is the Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
There are different gifts, but the same Spirit.
There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
And there are different operations, but it is the same God who works in all.
The manifestation expression of the Spirit is given to everyone for a beneficial purpose.
For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the one Spirit;
To another the workings of miracles and to another prophesy. To another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.
But in all these the same Spirit works, making a distribution to each one as he God wills.
For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many and are one body, so also is Christ.
For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we are Jews or people of the nations, whether we are bond or free; we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
For the body is not one member, but many.
If the foot should say: "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body;" is it therefore not of the body?
If the ear should say: "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body;" is it therefore not of the body?
If the whole body were an eye, where is the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where is the smelling?
Has God set the members of the body, every one of them, just as it pleased him?
And if they were all one member, where would the body be?
But now they are many members, yet they are one body.
And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you:" nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
Those members of the body, which seem to be weaker, are necessary.
And those members of the body that we think to be less honorable, we offer these more honors. Our less acceptable parts have more abundant acceptability.
For our acceptable parts have no need. But God has assembled the body together, having given more abundant honor to the part that was lacking.
There should be no division in the body. So the members should have the same care for each other.
When one member suffers all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
God has appointed some in the congregation: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helpers, abilities to direct, different tongues.
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
Do all have the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
Zealously seek earnestly desire the best gifts. Yet I show you a more excellent way.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and do not have love, I have become like loud sounding brass, or a clashing cymbal.
If I have the gift of prophesy, and know all secrets and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not arrogant proud.
Love does not act indecently. It is not selfish. It is not provoked and does not take into account a wrong suffered.
Love does not rejoice with evil, but rejoices with the truth.
It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.
Love never fails. Where there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away. Where there are tongues, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away.
For we know in part and we prophesy in part.
When the perfect comes, the partial imperfect incomplete will be done away.
When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, and reason like a child. When I became an adult I did away with childish things.
For now we see in a mirror dimly, and then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.
Faith, hope and love remain. These three! The greatest of these is love!
Pursue love, yet zealously desire spiritual gifts, especially prophesy proclaiming God’s Word.
For the person who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to men, but to God. No man understands him. He speaks secrets by the spirit.
But the person who prophesies proclaims God’s Word openly speaks to men to build up, encourage and comfort.
The person who speaks in an unknown tongue enlightens himself; but he who declares God’s Word enlightens the entire congregation!
I would like it that you all speak with tongues, but I prefer that you prophesy. The person who announces teaches preaches God’s Word is greater than the person who speaks with tongues. The person who speaks with tongues should have an interpreter so the congregation may receive understanding and knowledge.
Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
Inanimate objects that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
If the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?
The same for you unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will speak into the air.
There are many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
Therefore if I do not know the meaning of what someone is saying I will be a foreigner to him that speaks. And he that speaks will be a foreigner to me too.
As much as you are zealous for spiritual gifts, strive to build-up increase the enlightenment understanding of the congregation.
Let the one who speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret what he says.
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding mind is unfruitful.
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding Greek: nous: mind also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding mind also.
When you bless with the spirit, how will the audience of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you said?
For you give thanks well, but the other is not given understanding.
I thank God that I speak with tongues more then all of you.
Yet in the congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
Brothers, do not be like children in understanding. When it comes to evil be innocent children but in your thinking be mature adults.
It is written in the law: "With men of other tongues and lips of foreigners I will speak to this people. Even then they will not listen to me," said Jehovah.
Therefore speaking in tongues is a sign not for believers, but for those who do not believe. Prophesying proclaiming God’s Word serves the believer and not the unbeliever.
If therefore the whole congregation comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and the unlearned, or unbelievers, come there will they not say that you are out of your mind?
But if all proclaim God’s Word and an unbeliever comes there he is convinced by all.
The secrets of his heart are made known. So falling down on his face he will worship God, and report, "God is truly among you."
How is it then, brothers? When you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, and has an interpretation. Let all things be done to clarify and offer understanding!
If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three. It should be orderly by plan and someone must interpret.
But if there is no interpreter, let the speaker keep silence in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.
Let two or three prophets speak and let the others listen.
If there is a revelation to another while sitting there, let the others keep quiet.
You may all prophesy one by one in turn that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
Let the prophets control the spirits minds mental disposition of the prophets.
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the congregations of the holy ones.
Let women keep silent in the congregations. They are not permitted to speak. They must be in submission as it says in the law.
When they want to learn something, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is improper for a woman to speak in the congregation.
Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
But if any man does not recognize understand this he will not be recognized.
Seek to prophesy brothers, and do not forbid speaking with tongues.
Let all things be done decently and in order.
Brothers, I declared the good news to you. You have received it and should continue strong in it.
You will be saved through the good news if you hold fast to the word I preached to you. That way you will not believe in vain.
First of all, I delivered to you what I also received, how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
He was buried, and he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.
He was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles.
More than five hundred brothers saw him at the same time after that. Most of them remain to this day, but some have fallen asleep in death.
Then he was seen by James, and then by all the apostles.
And last of all I also saw him, as of one with an untimely birth.
I am the least of the apostles and do not deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the people of God.
By the divine influence of God I am what I am. His grace was not given to me in vain for I labored more than all of them. Yet it was not I. It was the divine influence and favor of God in me.
Therefore whether they preached or I preached, you believed.
If we preached that Christ was raised from the dead, how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen.
And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is worth nothing, and your faith is also without value.
We are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified that God raised Christ from the dead. If he did not raise him up from the dead then the dead are not raised up.
For if the dead are not raised up then Christ has not been raised.
And if Christ is not resurrected, your faith is worth nothing, and you are still in your sins.
Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable pitiable.
Christ has risen from the dead, and has become the first fruits of those who slept in death.
Death came because of what one man did. The resurrection of the dead also comes because of what one man did.
In Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.
Everyone will be raised to life in the right order: Christ the first fruits and afterward those who belong to Christ at the time of his coming.
In the end Christ will deliver the kingdom to God the Father. Christ will destroy every ruler and all authority and all power.
For he Christ must rule as king until he God puts all enemies under his feet his control.
The last enemy to be destroyed will be death.
According to the Scriptures: God has placed all things under his control subjection. But when he said all things are placed under him, it is with the exception of God. For God is the one who placed all things under him Christ.
When all things shall be subdued under the Son, then the Son will also be subjected to God who put all things under him, that God may be all in all ruler over everything.
What will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?
Why do we stand in jeopardy in danger every hour?
I face death daily even as I rejoice over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.
If I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage was it to me if the dead do not rise? Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.
Do not be deceived: Bad company corrupts good morals.
Wake up to righteousness and do not sin. Some do not have knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
But someone will say: How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?
You fool, that which you sow is not alive unless it first dies.
That which you sow, you sow not that body that will develop, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other grain:
But God gives it a body as it pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
There are also celestial heavenly bodies and terrestrial earthly bodies. The glory of the celestial is one thing and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For one star differs from another star in glory.
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption. It is raised in incorruption.
It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness and it is raised in power.
It is sown a natural body and it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.
Thus it is written: "The first man Adam was made a living being." The last Adam became a life giving spirit!
How is it the first is not spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
The first man is from the earth, earthy: the second man is from heaven.
As is the earthy so are those who are of the earth. And as is the heavenly, so are those who are of heaven.
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Corruption may not inherit incorruption.
Behold, I show you a secret. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last reverberation of the trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
When this corruptible shall be clothed with Greek: enduo: dressed, put on incorruption, and this mortal shall be clothed with immortality, then the saying will come true: "Death is swallowed up in victory."
"O death, where is your sting power to hurt? O grave, where is your victory?"
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
But thanks to God, because he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and unmovable. Always have plenty to do in the work of the Lord, for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
Now concerning the collection for the holy ones, you should do the same as I told the congregations of Galatia.
On one day of the week let every one of you set something aside, as God has prospered you, that there be no contributions collected when I come. Greek: heis, number one
When I come, whomever you approve by your letters, I will send to bring your gift to Jerusalem.
If it is fitting that I also go they will go with me.
Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I do pass through Macedonia.
And it may be that I will stay there and winter with you, that you may send me on my journey where ever I go.
I will not see you now by the way; but I plan to stay a while with you, if the God permits.
I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost.
For a great door that leads to activity is opened to me. Yet there are many people working against me.
Now if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear, for he works the work of God, as I also do.
Let no one despise him. But conduct him in peace that he may come to me, for I look for him with the brothers.
Concerning our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers but his will was not at all to come at this time. He will come when he has a convenient time.
Be alert be watchful and stand fast be vigilant persevere in the faith, carry on as men be courageous, be strong.
Do everything with love.
I exhort you, brothers, you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the holy ones.
That you submit yourselves to such, and to every one that helps with us, and labors.
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. For they have supplied what was lacking on your part.
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge them.
The congregations of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord, with the congregation that is in their house.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
The greeting from me Paul is with my own hand.
If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come O Lord!
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you.
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the congregation of God at Corinth, with all the holy ones throughout Achaia:
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort.
He comforts us in all our trouble, that we may be able to comfort those who also have trouble, through the comfort with which we are comforted from God.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.
If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort. It works through patience and longsuffering and is the same sufferings that we also suffer.
Our hope for you is steadfast; knowing that, as you are partakers of the sufferings, so you also partake of the comfort.
We do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that began in Asia. We were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.
Yes, we have had the sentence of death within ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead.
God delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us. We have set our hope on him. He will deliver us!
You also helped with your prayer on our behalf. Many may give thanks for the gift granted to us.
This is our pride and testimony of conscience. In holiness and Godly sincerity we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you. It was not by fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God.
For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end:
as also you did acknowledge us in part, that we are your reason to be proud, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
In this confidence I was willing to come to you first that you might have a second benefit.
To pass by you to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be helped by you on my journey to Judea.
When I planned this was I unfaithful? Or in other things do I perform according to the flesh. With me should there be a yes or a no?
But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we, preached among you even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in him is yes.
All the promises of God in him are yes. Also in his is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.
He who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God.
He also sealed us, and gave us the guarantee of the Spirit in our hearts.
But I call God for a witness against me. To spare you I did not come to Corinth.
We do not control your faith. We are fellow workers for your joy: for you stand fast in faith.
I decided this for myself that I would not come again to you with sorrow.
For if I make you sad, who then makes me glad? It is the same one whom I made sad.
I wrote this very thing that when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice. I have confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears. Not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you.
But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part that I press not too heavily to you all.
Sufficient to such a one is this punishment that was inflicted by the many.
To the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excess sorrow.
I urge you to confirm your love toward him.
I write for this purpose, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.
Whoever you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ,
that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,
I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother: but leaving them, I went to Macedonia.
Thanks to God, who always leads us in triumph triumphal procession in Christ. He makes known through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.
For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God. We are an aroma for those who are saved and those who perish.
To the one an aroma of death leading to death and to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?
For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God; but sincere and from God. We speak in Christ in the sight of God.
Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you or from you?
You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men.
It is known that you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of flesh that are of the heart.
We have such confidence through Christ toward God.
We are not adequate by ourselves to account for anything. Our adequacy is from God.
He also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant. This is a covenant not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
The ministry of death was written and engraved on stones. Glory came with it so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly upon the face of Moses. And this glory was passing away.
How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be with glory?
For if the ministry of condemnation has glory then the ministry of righteousness would exceed in glory.
Even what was glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the greater glory.
If that which passes away was with glory, that which remains is even more glorious.
Since we have such a hope we use great boldness of speech.
We are not like Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look steadily on the end of that which was passing away:
Their minds were blinded. Until this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant. It is not revealed to them that Christ voided it.
But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.
When one turns to God, the veil is taken away.
Now God is the Spirit and where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty freedom.
We all, with unveiled face, behold as in a mirror the glory of God and are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, exactly as from God’s Spirit.
We have this ministry to do, even as we obtained mercy, we do not lose heart.
We have renounced the hidden things of shame. And we do not walk in craftiness and deceit. We do not adulterate the word of God. But by the manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
If our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who perish.
The god of this age world religious, social, political, and economic arrangement has blinded the minds of unbelievers that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine on them.
We do not preach about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus as Lord. We are your servants for Jesus' sake.
God said: Light will shine out of darkness. He shined in our hearts. He gave the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face presence person of Jesus Christ.
We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the power beyond what is normal may be from God, and not from ourselves.
We are pressed afflicted troubled on every side, but not crushed. We are perplexed yet not to despair.
We are persecuted, yet not forsaken. We are struck down, yet not destroyed.
We always carry in the body the death of Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.
For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our mortal flesh.
So then death works in us, but life in you.
But having the same spirit attitude of faith, according to that which is written, I believe, and therefore I speak. We also believe, and therefore we also speak.
We know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.
All things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
We do not give up! Though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.
Our light affliction is for the moment. It works more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory for us.
We do not look at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal for a season. But the things that are not seen are eternal.
We know that if our earthly house human body habitation of life is destroyed; we have a building from God. It is an everlasting house in the heavens, not made with human hands.
In this we sigh in silent prayer, longing to be clothed with our habitation that is from heaven.
Indeed being clothed we will not be found naked.
While in this tabernacle we groan and sigh with prayer. We are concerned that we would be clothed with what is mortal and be swallowed up devoured by this life.
He that prepared us for this very purpose is God. He gave the Spirit to us as a guarantee pledge security.
We are always confident for we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.
We walk by faith, not by sight.
We are of good courage, I say, and are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
We make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to him.
We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it is good or bad.
We know what it means to respect the Lord so we persuade others. God knows us and I hope that you know us in your hearts consciences.
We are not again commending ourselves to you. But we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us. That way you may have an answer for those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
For if we are beside ourselves crazy insane it is to God. If we are of sound mind, it is to you.
For the love of Christ compels us to judge, that one died for all and therefore all died.
He died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for their sakes and rose again.
From now on we know no man according to the flesh: even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no longer.
If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things have passed away. Behold, they have become new.
All things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ. He gave the ministry of reconciliation to us.
God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ. He was not imputing their trespasses against them, for he had committed the word of reconciliation to us.
We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ that you be reconciled to God.
He made the one who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf. That way we might become the righteousness of God in him.
Working together with him we plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain to no purpose in emptiness.
For he said: At an acceptable time I listened to you. In a day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation!
Give no occasion for stumbling offence in anything that our ministry may not be blamed discredited.
In everything we commend ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watching, in fasting;
in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,
in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
Also as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
O Corinthians, we have spoken openly to you, our figurative heart is wide open enlarged.
We do not restrict you, but you are restricted by your own affections.
Now in return for the same in like kind I speak as to my children, you also be open open your hearts wide!
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship does righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what communion does light have with darkness?
And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
And what agreement does a temple of God have with idols? We are the temple of the living God. God said: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
Therefore come out from among them and be separate set off severed from them excluded from them, said Jehovah. Do not touch the unclean thing and I will receive you.
I will be a Father to you, and you will be to me sons and daughters, said Jehovah God the Almighty.
Having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness with deep reverence for God.
Open your hearts to us. We wronged no person. We wronged and corrupted no one. We took advantage of no person.
I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.
Great is my confidence in you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in our entire affliction.
When we came to Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side, fighting on the outside and fears on the inside.
Nevertheless he who comforts the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus.
This is not by his coming only, but also by the comfort he brought from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me so that I rejoiced yet more.
For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it for I see that that letter made you sorry, though but for a season,
I now rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance; for you were made sorry after a godly fashion, that you might not suffer loss by us.
For godly sorrow works repentance leading to salvation. This is a repentance that brings no regret: but the sorrow of the world works death.
This very thing that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it made in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, yes what vindication! You demonstrated yourself to innocent in the matter.
Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the one who did wrong, nor for the one who suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God.
Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. We enjoyed our comfort the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because all of you have refreshed his mental disposition.
If in anything I have boasted about him to you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our boasting also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.
His affection is even greater for you as he remembers your obedience and how with reverence and trembling you received him.
I rejoice that in everything I am encouraged because of you.
We make known to you brothers the grace of God that has been given to the congregations of Macedonia.
Out of severe affliction they have an abundance of joy and their deep poverty abounds in the riches of their generosity.
For according to their ability, I bear witness, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord.
They were very urgent in their concern for this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the holy ones.
This is not as we hoped. First they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
We exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.
But as you have plenty of everything, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love for us, see that you have plenty of this undeserved kindness also.
I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.
I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.
But now complete the doing. There was the eager will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have.
I do not say this for the ease of others and for your affliction
but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:
as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.
But thanks to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth to you of his own accord.
And we have sent together with him the brother, whose praise in the good news has spread through all the congregations,
and not only so, but who was also appointed by the congregations to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness.
Avoid this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty that is ministered by us:
for we think of honorable things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of men.
We send our brother with them, whom we have many times proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.
Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you or our brothers, they are the messengers of the congregations, and they are the glory of Christ.
Show to them as representatives of the congregations the quality of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
I do not need to write you about the ministry to the holy ones.
I know you are ready and I boast about to the Macedonians. That Achaia has been prepared since last year. Your zeal stirred up many of them.
But I have sent the brothers that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect. Even as I said, you may be prepared:
Lest by any means, if any from Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to speak of you, should be put to shame in this respect.
I thought it necessary therefore to request the brothers to go before me to you, and prepare your generous gift before hand, that the same might be ready as a gift and not extortion.
He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will reap bountifully.
Let each man do according as he has purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
God is able to make all grace abound toward you. You have plenty of everything you need and should abound in every good work.
As it is written: He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor. His righteousness abides forever.
The one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.
You will be made rich in everything. And you can be generous on every occasion. This will cause thanksgiving to God through us.
This service not only takes care of the needs of the holy ones, but also abounds with many expressions of thanksgiving to God.
The proof of this ministry is that they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the good news of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men.
They pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.
I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.
The weapons we use in our fight are not of the flesh but God's powerful weapons, which we use to destroy strongholds. We destroy false arguments.
We cast down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God. We bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.
We are ready to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
You look at the things that are before you. If any man trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself that, even as he is Christ's, so also are we.
I should boast a great deal concerning the authority the Lord gave us to build you up, and not to tear you down, I would not be put to shame.
I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong. But his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account.
Let a person like this take this into account: what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such we will also be in deed when we are present.
For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves. But they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves. They are without understanding.
But we will not boast beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province that God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even to you.
For we are not overstretching ourselves though we did not reach to you. We reached out to you with the good news of Christ.
We did not boast beyond our assignment in other men's labors. Having hope that, as your faith grows, we shall be made great among you according to our territory for further abundance.
Let us preach the good news to the parts beyond you. Let us not boast in someone else’s territory in concerning things ready for our hand.
But he who boasts let him boast in Jehovah!
It is not he that commends himself that is approved. It is the one whom Jehovah commends.
I hope you can put up with me in a little foolishness: but indeed you do put up with me.
For I am zealous over you with a godly fervor ardor zeal! For I promised you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds will be lead away from the simplicity and the purity cleanness that is toward Christ.
If someone comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you do well to put up with him.
For I do not consider myself inferior to the super apostles.
Though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. We have in every way made this evident to you in all things.
Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you the good news of God without charge?
I robbed other congregations, taking pay from them that I might minister to you.
When I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man. For the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will continue to do the same.
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me from doing this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
Why? Is it because I do not love you? God knows I do!
But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that in whatever matter they boast, they may be found equal with me.
For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.
And no wonder for even Satan fashions himself into an angel of light.
It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.
I say again, let no man think me foolish. If you do, yet receive me as foolish that I also may boast a little.
That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.
You being wise tolerate the foolish.
You suffer, if a man brings you into bondage, if a man devours you, if a man takes advantage of you, if a man exalts himself, if a man strikes you on the face.
I speak concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. If any are bold, I speak foolishly for I am also bold.
Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I!
Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more in labors more abundant, beaten beyond number, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.
Of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.
Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, I suffered shipwreck three times, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.
In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;
In weariness and painfulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness.
Beside those things that are from the outside, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the congregations.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I do not burn with indignation?
If I need to boast, I will boast about the things that concern my infirmities.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed forever knows I do not lie.
The governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me.
So I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him.
I must brag, although it does not do any good. I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body, I do not know; or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows, such a one caught up even to the third heaven.
And I know such a man whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows,
how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to speak.
I will brag about this person, but I will not brag about myself unless it is about my weaknesses.
If I ever wanted to brag, I would not be a fool. Instead, I would be telling the truth. But I am going to spare you so that no one may think more of me than what he sees or hears about me.
I was given a painful physical ailment that will keep me from being puffed up with pride because of the many wonderful things I saw. It acts as Satan's messenger to beat me and keep me from being proud.
Three times I prayed to God about this and asked him to take it away.
He told me: "My grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore, I would rather glory in my infirmities frailities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me cover me like a tent descend upon me abide with me.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.
I have become a fool in boasting. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended about you: for in nothing am I inferior to the most prominent apostles, though I am nothing.
Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
What is it in which you were inferior to other congregations, except that I was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.
Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you. I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you. The children should not provide for the parents, but the parents for the children.
I will gladly spend and be spent for you. When I love you more abundantly should I be loved less.
Just the same, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning.
Did I gain you by any of them whom I sent to you?
I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus gain you? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same mental disposition? Did we not walk in the same steps?
Do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for you ’ re up building.
I am afraid that I may come and find you different from what I want you to be, and that you may find me different from what you want me to be. I fear that there may be rivalry, jealousy, hot tempers, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct.
I am afraid that the next time I come my God will humiliate me in your presence, and I shall weep over many who sinned in the past and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication and loose conduct that they have practiced.
This is now the third time that I am coming to visit you. The testimony of two or three witnesses must uphold an accusation.
I told you in advance as if I were present the second time. Being absent now I write to those who have sinned and to all others. If I come again I will not spare you.
Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you but is mighty in you.
Though he was impaled through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. We are weak through him also, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith. Prove your own selves. Do you not know this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is with you, unless you are disqualified?
I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.
Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we may seem disqualified.
We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
We are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong. We also pray that you be readjusted.
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power that the Lord gave me to enlightenment and not to destruction.
Finally brothers, farewell: Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the holy ones salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the intimate sharing of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
From Paul, who is an apostle not from men nor through men but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.
And from the brothers who are with me, to the congregations of Galatia:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
He Jesus gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us out of this present evil age. This is according to the will of our God and Father.
To him is glory forever and ever. Amen.
I am amazed that you so quickly turned away from the One who called you by the grace of Christ. You turned to different good news.
Yet this is not another good news. But there are some who trouble agitate you, and they would pervert the good news of Christ.
If we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any message other than that which we preached to you, let him be accursed condemned expelled.
We said before and now I say again, if any man preaches to you any message other than what you received, let him be accursed!
Do I now seek the favor of men, or of God? Am I striving to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
For I make known to you brothers that the good news that was preached by me is not according to man.
I did not receive it from man. I was not taught it! It came to me through revelation from Jesus Christ.
You heard about the way I lived as a Jew. How I persecuted the congregation of God beyond measure. In fact I tried to destroy it!
I advanced as a Jew beyond many of my own age among my countrymen. I was more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
It pleased God to separate me even from my mother’s womb and call me through his grace.
He revealed his Son to me that I might preach him among the nations. I do not confer with flesh and blood human beings.
I did not go to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was. I went away to Arabia and again I returned to Damascus.
Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and waited with him fifteen days.
But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.
What I write is true. God knows I do not lie.
Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
I was still unknown by face to the congregations of Judea that are in Christ.
They heard it said: "He that once persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy."
They glorified God because of me.
Fourteen years later I went again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus with me also.
I went in response to a revelation. I demonstrated to them the way I spread the good news among the people of the nations. I did this privately before them for they have a reputation. I am concerned that by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.
Titus was with me and he was not persuaded to be circumcised. He is a Greek.
This occurred because of the false brothers brought in secretly. They came to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus. This was so they might bring us into bondage.
We did not yield to them for a moment or an hour! That way the truth of the good news the whole body of Christian teachings might continue with you.
Those who were recognized as important people did not add a single thing to my message. What sort of people they were makes no difference to me. God does not play favorites show partiality.
On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news to people who are not circumcised. Just as Peter had been entrusted with the good news to the people who are circumcised.
The one who made Peter an apostle to the Jewish people who are circumcised also made me an apostle to the people of the nations who are not circumcised.
When they saw the grace that was given to me, James, Cephas Peter and John, they who were known to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship. We were to go to the nations and they were to go to the people who are circumcised.
They wanted us to remember the poor. I was eager zealous to do this very thing.
When Cephas came to Antioch, I openly resisted him because he was completely wrong.
He ate with the people of the nations until some men James sent arrived. When they arrived, he drew back and separated himself. He feared those who were of the circumcised people.
The rest of the Jews were hypocrites with him, so much that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the good news. Therefore I said to Cephas, in front of them all: "If you, being a Jew, live as the nations do and not as the Jews, why do you compel the people of the nations to live like the Jews?"
We are Jews by birth, and not sinners from the nations.
Yet we know that a man is not righteous by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. We believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be righteous by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law. The works of the law justify no one.
We sought to be righteous in Christ. And we were found to be sinners. Is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.
If I build up again the things that I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.
I, through the law, died to the law that I might live to for God.
I have been impaled with Christ. It is no longer I that live, but Christ lives in me. The life that I now live in the flesh physical body I live by faith. This is the faith that is in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself up for me.
I do not reject the grace totally undeserved gift of God: for if righteousness is gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
O foolish Galatians, who fascinated cast a spell over beguiled influenced you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was openly presented impaled.
I want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law, or by having faith in what you heard?
Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now made perfect mature in the flesh?
Did you suffer so many things in vain? Does it have no purpose?
He that provides the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
Abraham believed God and "Jehovah considered his faith as his righteousness."
You know that those who have faith are sons of Abraham.
The Scripture revealed ahead of time, that God justified the people of the nations by faith. He preached the good news beforehand to Abraham. He said: "In you will all the nations be blessed."
So then those who have faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
Those who are of the works of the Law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the Law, by obeying them."
The fact that the Law justifies no man before God is evident. The righteous will live by faith.
The Law is not based on faith. "He that does them will live by them."
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. It is written; "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a stake."
This way the blessing of Abraham might come upon the nations through Christ Jesus and we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Brothers, I speak like a man speaks: Though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.
The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He did not say to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.
Now this I say: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.
If the inheritance is based on the Law, it is no longer based on a promise. However God granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.
What then is the law? It was added to cause awareness of sin because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
A mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.
Is the Law then against the promises of God? God forbid! If a law had been given which could impart life, righteousness would have been from the Law.
But the Scriptures shut up imprisoned pictured all things mankind under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
But before faith came the Law held us in custody. We were locked up until faith was revealed.
The Law was our schoolmaster Greek: paedagogue: a combination of schoolmaster, instructor, servant and guardian in charge of us to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
For as many of you who were baptized into Christ put on clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one united in Christ Jesus.
If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.
But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he does not differ from a bondservant, though he is owner of the estate.
He is under guardians and stewards until the day set by the father.
When we were children, we too were held in bondage. We were slaves to the arrangement of this world.
When the full time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
Because you are sons, God sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
So you are no longer slaves but a son. And as a son God has made you an heir.
However at that time, you did not know God. You were in bondage to things that are really not gods at all.
Now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and poor fundamental things? Do you want to slave for them all over again?
You observe days and months, seasons and years.
I fear for you, that I have labored for you to no purpose and failed.
I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also used to be as you are. You did me no wrong.
You know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the good news to you the first time.
That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you did not despise or reject. You received me like an angel messenger of God, even like Christ Jesus.
Where then is your positive attitude? I bear you witness, that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
So then have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
They zealously eagerly seek you in no good way. They desire to shut you out, that you may seek them.
It is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.
My little children, of whom I am again in labor pains until Christ is formed in you
I wish to be present with you now, and to speak in a different way, for I am perplexed about you.
Tell me, you that desire to be under the Law; do you not hear the Law?
It is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman, and one by the freewoman.
How is it that the son by the slave woman is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise?
This contains an allegory symbolic drama. These women symbolize two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.
Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She corresponds to the Jerusalem that now is. She is in bondage with her children.
The Jerusalem above is free. She is our mother.
It is written, "Rejoice, barren woman who does not give birth. Break forth and cry, you who do not labor; for there are more children of the desolate than of the one who has the husband."
Brothers, we are children who belong to the promise, the same as Isaac was.
Just like then, the son who was conceived in a natural way according to the flesh persecuted the son conceived in a spiritual way. That is exactly what is happening now!
What do the scriptures say? "Throw out the slave woman and her son. For the son of the slave woman must not share the inheritance with the son of the free woman."
Brothers, we are not children of a slave woman but of the free woman.
Christ liberated us for freedom moral liberty. Stand fast therefore, and do not become entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
Behold, I Paul say to you, that, if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision. He is under obligation to obey the whole Law.
You who seek to be righteous by Law are separated from Christ. You have fallen away from grace.
For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision means anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.
You were running well! Who hindered you that you should not obey the truth?
This persuasion did not come from him who calls you.
A little leaven, leavens ferments the whole lump.
I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view. And he that troubles you will bear his judgment, who ever he is.
But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then has the stumbling block of the stake been done away?
I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
For you brothers, were called for freedom; only do not use your freedom for an occasion to the flesh. Serve one another through love!
For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
But if you continue to bite and devour one another, take care that you do not consume one another.
I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. These are in opposition to one another that you may not do the things that you would.
But if the Spirit leads you, you are not under the Law.
Now the works of the flesh sinful human nature are apparent. They are: fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct,
idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, wrath, contentions, divisions, sects,
envies, drunkenness, revelries, and things like these. I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things would not inherit the kingdom of God.
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
meekness mildness, self-control; against such there is no law.
Those who belong to Christ Jesus have impaled the flesh with its passions and lusts.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.
Brothers, if someone is caught in any kind of wrongdoing, those of you who are spiritual should set him right. But you must do it in a gentle way. And keep an eye on yourselves, so that you will not be tempted, too.
Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.
So if any one of you thinks you are important when you really are not, you are only fooling yourself.
Each of you must examine your own actions. Then you can be proud of your own accomplishments without comparing yourself to others.
For each person should carry his own load.
But let him that is orally taught in the word share all good things.
Do not be deceived. God is not mocked! A man will harvest what he sows.
He that sows to his own flesh will harvest corruption of the flesh. But he that sows to the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit.
Let us not grow tired of doing good things for in due season we shall harvest, if we do not faint.
So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.
See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.
Those who desire to make a showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised. This is done so they may not be persecuted for the stake of Christ.
For not even those who receive circumcision obey the Law. They desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
Never should I boast except in the stake symbolic: self-denial and atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is through this stake that the world has been impaled to me, and I to the world.
For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision anything, but a new creature is.
The Israel of God will have peace and mercy. All who walk by this rule will also.
Let no one trouble me. I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
The grace Greek: charis, divine favor, loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Greek: pneuma, mental outlook, attitude, brothers. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the holy ones who are at Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places through Christ.
He chose us through him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love.
He predetermined ordained us to adoption, as sons to himself through Jesus Christ, according to the kind intention of his will.
This is to the praise of the glory of his kindness, with which he freely honored us, the loved ones.
In him we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace.
He made this undeserved kindness abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence insight.
He made known to us the secret of his will, according to his good pleasure and purpose.
It was for an administration at the appointed time. This administration is to gather up all things in Christ, the things in heaven, and the things upon the earth. Yes in him!
We were assigned as heirs predetermined according to his purpose. He works all things according to his direction and will.
We who were first to hope in Christ should serve to the praise of his glory.
You have heard the word of the truth in Christ. It is the good news about your salvation. You also believed and were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.
The Holy Spirit is a guarantee that we will receive our inheritance. This assures us that God will set us free to the praise of his glory.
For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus that is among you, and the love you show all the holy ones.
I continually give thanks for you in my prayers.
May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, give you a spirit mental disposition of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
Have the eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know the hope of his calling, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the holy ones,
and what the exceeding greatness of his power is toward us who believe, according to the operation of his mighty strength.
He operated in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places.
It is far above all governments and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come.
He God put all things in subjection under his feet, and made him head over all things to the congregation,
which is his body, the fullness of him who fills accomplishes completes all in all.
You were once dead because of your trespasses and sins.
You once walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the power authority and jurisdiction of the air, the spirit that is now active in the sons of disobedience.
We all once lived in the lust of our flesh, indulging the desires lusts of the flesh and of the mind. We were by nature children of anger and violent passion, like everyone else.
But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,
even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ. For by grace loving-kindness you have been saved.
God raised us up with him and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, with Christ Jesus.
So in the ages to come he, with Christ Jesus, might show the exceeding surpassing exceptional riches of his grace with kindness toward us.
By grace Greek: charis, divine favor, loving-kindness you have been saved through faith. It is not from you. It is the gift from God!
It is not the result of works. So no man should boast.
For we are his workmanship created with Christ Jesus for good works. God prepared these works in advance that we should walk in them.
Remember that you were once people of the nations in the flesh. You are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made by human hands.
You were separate from Christ at that time, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel. You were strangers from the covenants of the promise. You had no hope and were without God in the world.
You were once far off but now with Christ Jesus, the blood of Christ has brought you near.
For he is our peace, who made both Jews and Gentiles one, and broke down the middle barrier of partition.
Christ abolished in his flesh the enmity ill will, which the law of commandments contained in ordinances. That way he might create one new man, out of the two, with himself establishing peace.
So he reconciled them both in one body to God through the stake. He put to death the enmity antagonism hostility.
He came and preached peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near.
We both have access to the Father by one Spirit through him.
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens. You are fellow citizens with the holy ones and of the household of God.
You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone.
In him each building fits together and grows into a "holy Temple for Jehovah."
In Christ you are assembled together as a place for God’s Spirit to dwell.
For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you people of the nations.
You have heard of the stewardship of God’s loving kindness that was given to me with you in view.
The secret was made known to me by revelation, just as I wrote before in few words.
When you read this you can understand my insight into the secret of Christ.
It was not made known to other generations of the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
The Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news.
I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace that was given me according to the working of his power.
To me, the very least of all the holy ones, was given grace loving divine influence to preach to the people of the nations the untraceable riches of Christ.
To make all men see what is the administration of the secret which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things.
It is the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known through the congregation and the rules and authorities in the heavenly places.
This is according to the eternal purpose determination design arrangement that He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord.
We have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
So I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations for you, for they are your glory.
For this cause I bow my knees to the Father.
Every family in heaven and on earth obtains its name from him.
That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man.
May Christ dwell in your hearts through faith to the end that you will be rooted and grounded in love.
May you be able to comprehend with all the holy ones the breadth and length and height and depth.
And may you know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge. May you be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now to him that is able to do far more abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.
Glory be to him in the congregation and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, invite you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.
Walk with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, putting up with one another in love.
Diligently try to keep the unity oneness of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling.
There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.
There is one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
But unto each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Therefore it says: "When he ascended on high, he led captives, and gave gifts to men anthropos: human beings."
Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers.
This is for the perfecting equipping preparing of the holy ones, for the work of ministering, for the building up of the body of Christ:
until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown mature man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error.
By speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in all things to him. For he, Christ, is the head.
The entire body is properly framed and fitted together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in due measure of each individual part. It makes the body increase by building itself in love.
This I say therefore, and testify affirm in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the nations also walk, in the vanity futility depravity of their mind thinking.
They are darkened blinded obscured in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart.
They are past feeling. They have given themselves over to loose conduct, to work all uncleanness with greediness a lust for more.
But you did not learn Christ that way.
You learned him and were taught by him just as truth is in Jesus.
You put away your former way course behavior conversation of life, the old self that was corrupt with the lusts of deceit.
You are renewed in the spirit vital principles attitude of your mind understanding.
Put on the new man, that in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
Put away falsehood. Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor: for we are members belonging to together with of one another.
Be angry and do not sin. Do not let the sun go down upon your anger rage.
Do not give the devil an opportunity.
He that steals must steal no more. Let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to someone in need.
Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth. Speak what is good for understanding as the need may be, that it may give grace divine favor to those who hear.
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in which Greek: en hos in which Greek: hos, he ho whereby which you were sealed to the day of release by ransom.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and screaming, and abusive speech, be put away removed expiated from you, along with all malice.
You should be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also forgave you through by means of Christ.
Therefore imitate God like beloved children.
Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us. He was an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling odor.
Fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among holy ones.
Nor should there be filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting but rather giving of thanks.
For you know this with certainty, that no fornicator, no unclean person, no covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Let no one deceive you with empty words. It is because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
Do not be partakers with them.
You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk live be occupied as children of light
for the fruit of the light life spirit consists of all goodness and righteousness and truth.
Learn what is well pleasing to the Lord.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead reprove expose convict them.
For the things that are done by them in secret is a shame even to speak about.
But all things become visible when the light exposes them, for everything that becomes visible is light.
For this reason it says: "Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
Be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise.
Make the most of your time redeem or ransom back time, because the days are evil.
Do not be foolish, but understand perceive what the will of Jehovah is.
Do not get drunk with wine, for that is a public act of violence, but be filled with the Spirit.
Speak to one another in psalms and praise and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to Jehovah.
Always give thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father.
Be subject obedient subordinate to one another in reverence of Christ.
Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the congregation, he being the savior of the body.
The congregation is subject to Christ. Likewise let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.
Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.
This is so he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word.
So he will be able to present the congregation to himself as a glorious congregation, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. It should be holy and without blemish.
In this way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his own wife loves himself.
No man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also does the congregation.
And we are members of his body!
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and will stick adhere cleave be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.
This secret is great! I speak with regard to Christ and of the congregation.
Each one of you should love his own wife even as himself. The wife should respect her husband.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise.
Then it will go well with you, and you may live long on the earth.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of God.
Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of your heart, as to Christ.
This should not be in the way of eye service, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from a complete heart;
with goodwill doing service, as to God, and not to men.
You know that whatever good thing each person does, the same shall he receive again from God, whether he be slave or free.
You masters, do the same things to them. Do not threaten! You know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven. There is no favoritism with him.
Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in his mighty strength.
Put on the full armor every implement of God, that you may be able to stand against the cunning inventive clever methods of the devil.
Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly places.
For that reason, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, having done everything, to stand firm.
Stand firm therefore and gird your loins with truth. Put on the breastplate of righteousness.
Shod your feet with the preparation of the good news of peace.
Also take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.
Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
With prayer and supplication pray at all times in the Spirit. Watch with all perseverance and supplication for all the holy ones.
Pray on my behalf, that ability to speak may be given to me, to make known with boldness the secret of the good news.
I am an ambassador in chains who should speak boldly.
That you also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an incorruptible sincere principled unending love.
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in union with Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and ministerial servants:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God for all my memories of you.
I always offer prayer filled with joy for you,
and for your fellowship in participation of the good news from the first day until now.
I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.
It is right for me to feel this way on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the good news you are all partakers with me of grace.
God is my witness, how I long for you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment.
This way you may approve test the things that are excellent of more value. May you be sincere and without offense blameless to others till the day of Christ.
Be filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
I would have you know, brothers that the things that happened to me turned out for the greater progress of the good news.
My imprisonment in Christ became known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard, and to all brothers.
Most of the brothers trust in the Lord and boldly speak the word of God without fear because of my bonds.
Some preach Christ from envy and strife and some from good will.
The latter ones do it out of love, knowing that I am set appointed placed here for the defense of the good news.
But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition without pure motives, thinking to cause me great suffering and distress in my imprisonment.
What then? That in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed! For that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice!
For I know that this will turn out to my redemption through your prayer and the provision of the spirit vital principles mind of Jesus Christ.
I will not be put to shame according to my earnest expectation and hope. With all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in me, whether by life or by death.
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
If I live in the flesh this will bring fruit from my labor. I do not know what to choose.
I am hard pressed between the two. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ for it is far better.
Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
Having this confidence, I know that I will remain. Yes, I will remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith.
Let your rejoicing abound in Christ Jesus through my presence with you again.
Let your manner of life be worthy of the good news about Christ. Whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your conduct, that you stand fast in one spirit common purpose mental disposition vital principle, with one mind striving together for the faith of the good news.
Do not be frightened by opponents. This is evidence of destruction for them and salvation for you from God.
It has been granted to you in behalf of Christ. Not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf.
You have the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
If there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender affection tender mercy and compassions,
make my joy full by being of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, and of one purpose.
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility consider others more important than you.
Look out for the interest of others and not only for your own personal interest.
Have this attitude mind-set understanding mental state in you that was also in Christ Jesus.
He existed in the form shape and nature of God but did not try to be equal with God. He did not even consider it!
He emptied humbled himself by taking the form of a servant. He was made in the likeness of men.
He obtained the appearance as a man, humbled himself, and became obedient even to death, yes, death on the stake.
For this reason God highly exalted him, and gave to him the name that is above every name, Relative authority given by Jehovah God, the Father to His Son
that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
My beloved, you have always obeyed, not just in my presence, but now much more in my absence. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
It is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
Do all things without complaining grumbling murmuring and questioning disputing.
That way you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. You are seen as lights in the world.
Hold fast to the word of life so I may rejoice in the day of Christ. That way I will not have labored in vain.
If I am offered for the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with you all.
You should also rejoice in the same manner.
I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly that I may be encouraged when I know your circumstances.
For I have no man likeminded, who will truly care for you.
They all seek their own interest and not the things of Jesus Christ.
But you know of his proven worth. It was like a son with his father that he served with me to further the good news.
I hope to send him as soon as I see how it goes with me.
I trust in the Lord that I also will come shortly.
I find it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. He is my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.
He longed to see you and was worried because you had heard that he was sick.
Indeed he was sick and near to death. But God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
I have sent him quickly, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy. Hold such in honor
because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
Finally my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not a bother, but for you it is a safeguard.
Beware of the dogs impure men false teachers! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilation of the body.
We are those with true circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God. We glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh.
I might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I have more!
I was circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
Things that offered gain to me I count a loss for Christ.
I count all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. I suffered the loss of all things. Yet I count them as refuse garbage dung that I may gain Christ.
I want to be united with him. I no longer want a righteousness of my own that is gained by obeying the law. The righteousness from God is by faith in Christ.
I want to know him and the power of his resurrection. I want to know the fellowship of his sufferings and become conformed to his death.
I wish to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect. But I press on, that I may obtain that for which Christ Jesus also obtained.
Brothers, I could not yet have obtained it. But one thing I do, I forget the things that are behind, and stretch forward to the things that are ahead.
I press on toward the goal to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Let those of us who are mature have this attitude. If you have a different attitude God will show you how to think.
However, we should be guided by what we have learned so far.
Brothers, be imitators of me. Pay attention to those who live by the example we have given you.
Many live as enemies of the stake of Christ. I often wept as I told you about them.
Their end is destruction. Their god is their belly. Their glory is in their shame. They set their mind on earthly things.
However, our citizenship is in heaven. We also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Christ will, through his power, bring everything under his authority. He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified glorious body literally and figuratively: body of his glory. He is able to subject all things to himself.
Therefore, my beloved brothers I long to see you. You are my joy and crown. In this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.
Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the good news, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice!
Let your gentleness mildness moderation be known to all men for the Lord is near.
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.
The things that you have learned, received, heard and saw in me; do these things and the God of peace will be with you.
I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me. You did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.
I am not saying this because I am in need; for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.
I know how to be poor. I also know how to live with abundance. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to have abundance and to suffer need.
I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
You did well that you share with me in my affliction.
You also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I departed from Macedonia, no other congregation shared their money with me. Only you shared with me.
While I was in Thessalonica you provided for my needs twice.
Not that I seek the gift but I seek the fruit that adds to your account.
I have all things, and prosper: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you. It is an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.
My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
All the holy ones greet you, especially they who are of Caesar's household.
The grace Greek: charis: divine influence of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Greek: pneuma: mental disposition.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
to the holy ones and faithful brothers in Christ that live in Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
We always pray for you, and thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for you.
We have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love you have for all the holy ones.
This is because of the hope reserved for you in heaven. You heard about this hope from the word of truth, the good news.
It came to you even as it did. Everywhere in the entire world it bears fruit and it increases in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace loving-kindness of God in truth.
You learned about Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf.
He also declared your love to us in the Spirit.
Since the day we heard about you, we have not ceased to pray and make request for you. We pray for you to be filled with the intimate accurate knowledge discernment recognition of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
Walk worthily of God, fully pleasing him. Bear fruit in every good work, and increase in the knowledge Greek: epignosis: full discernment, recognition of God.
God will strengthen you with all power, according to the might of his glory, to all patience and longsuffering with joy.
Give thanks to the Father, who made us partakers of the inheritance of the holy ones in the light.
He rescued us from the power of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love the Son he dearly loves.
We have in him our redemption and the forgiveness of our sins.
He is the image likeness representation of the invisible God. He is the firstborn Greek: prototokos: childbirth, offspring of all creation.
All things in the heavens and upon the earth where created through him. The things visible and invisible were created through him. Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.
He is before all things, and through him all things originate.
He is the head of the body, the congregation. He is the beginning commencement, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence first place.
It was the good pleasure of the Father that in him all the fullness should dwell.
And all things are reconciled through him. He made peace through the blood of his atonement of the stake. He reconciles all things, whether things upon the earth, or things in heaven.
You were in the past alienated and enemies because your minds were on your evil works.
But he Christ reconciled you in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and without accusation before Him God.
Provided that you continue in the faith, grounded on the foundation and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news you heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven. For this I, Paul, was made a minister.
I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake. I do my share in behalf of his body, the congregation, to provide what is lacking of the afflictions of Christ.
God gave me this stewardship to perform for your good. He has made me a servant of the congregation. It is for the task of fully proclaiming the word of God.
It is the secret he hid through all past ages from all human beings but has now revealed to his holy ones.
It was God’s will to make known his secret to the people of the nations, this rich and glorious secret that he has for people. The secret is that Christ is in union with you, which means that you will share in his glory.
We preach Christ to everyone. With all possible wisdom we warn and teach them in order to bring each one to God as a mature individual in union with Christ.
I work hard to get this done. I use the mighty strength Christ supplies. It is at work in me.
Let me tell you how hard I worked for you, for the people in Laodicea, and for all others who do not personally know me.
I do this that they may be filled with courage and be united knit together in love. I have the full assurance that only true understanding brings. In this way they will accurately know God’s secret, which is Christ himself.
In him is concealed all the hidden treasures of God’s wisdom and knowledge.
I tell you this: Do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments, no matter how good they seem to be.
Even though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit mental disposition. I am glad when I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ.
You have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord. Now walk live in union with him.
Keep your roots deep in him! Build your lives on him. Become stronger in your faith, as you were taught, and be filled with thanksgiving.
See to it that no one enslaves you by means of philosophy and worthless deceit of human wisdom according to tradition of men. It is according to the elementary principles of the world, and not from Christ.
The fullness of divine nature lives in Christ’s bodily form. Greek: theotes: essence and nature of God Only the Son of God could have divine attributes, the inherited qualities from the Father
You are made full complete perfect mature in him. He is the head over all government and authority.
You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.
You have been buried with him in baptism. You were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses.
He blotted out the bond written in ordinances. It was against us and was contrary to us. He has taken it out of the way. He nailed it to the stake.
He disarmed the rulers and authorities! He made a public display of them triumphing over them.
Let no man judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day.
They are a shadow of the things to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.
Let no man rob you of your prize by a self-abasement and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things that he has seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
not holding fast to the head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, grows with the growth from God.
If you died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances:
"Do not handle. Do not taste. Do not touch."
These are the precepts and doctrines of men.
These have, indeed, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body. But these are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
If you have been raised together with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
Think about the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.
For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ, who is our life, will be made known, then you will also be made known with him in glory.
Make your members that are upon the earth dead with regard to fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness greed, which is idolatry.
Because of such things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
You once walked in these when you lived in them.
Now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech out of your mouth.
Do not lie to one another, seeing that you got rid of the old self with its evil practices.
You put on the new self that is being renewed to a true knowledge full discernment according to the image of the one who created him.
There is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all and in all.
As God’s chosen, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness humility, meekness mildness, and long-suffering patience.
Tolerate endure suffer put up with one another, and forgive each other. If any man has a complaint against anyone, forgive them, even as God forgave you.
Above all these things, put on love, which is the bond of perfection and unity.
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts. You were called in one body for this purpose. You be thankful.
Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you with all wisdom. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, praises to God, and spiritual songs. Sing with gratitude in your hearts to God.
Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. Give thanks to God the Father through him.
Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.
Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.
Fathers, do not provoke your children, that they not be discouraged.
Servants, obey your masters according to the flesh in all things, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, respecting God.
Whatever you do, work at it without reservation, as to God, and not to men.
You know that God will give you the reward of the inheritance when you serve the Master, Christ.
For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong that he has done. There is no partiality.
Masters, give your servants that which is just and equal. You know that you also have a Master in heaven.
Continue steadfastly in prayer, being vigilant with thanksgiving.
Pray also for us that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned.
Let me make it known, as I ought to speak.
Behave with wisdom toward those who are outside, making the most of the time.
Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
Tychicus will make known all my affairs to you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our situation, and that he may comfort your hearts.
He will be with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things that are done here.
Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, receive him,
and Jesus that is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only are my fellow-workers for the kingdom of God, men that have been comfort encouragement consolation to me.
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
I testify for him, that he has worked hard for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nympha, and the congregation that is in her house.
When this letter has been read among you, make sure it is read also in the congregation of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
Say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry you received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians united with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers.
We continually remember your work of faith, labor of love, and patience, and your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.
We know your calling brothers, beloved of God.
We preached the good news to you, not in words only but with power from Holy Spirit and with conviction of its truth. You know how we lived when we were with you. It was for your own good.
You imitated the Lord and us, even though you suffered much affliction. Yet you received the word with the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit.
So you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
For not only did the message about God go out from you throughout Macedonia and Achaia, but the news about your faith in God has gone everywhere. There is nothing that we need to say.
All those people speak about how you received us when we visited you, and how you turned away from idols to God, to serve the true and living God,
and to wait for his Son to come from heaven, his Son Jesus, whom he raised from death and who rescues us from God’s anger indignation that is to come.
For you know brothers that our coming to you was not in vein.
After we suffered and were mistreated in Philippi, we had the boldness confidence in our God to speak the good news of God to you amid much opposition.
For our presentation exhortation is not based on error, or of uncleanness, or in deceit.
We always speak, as God wants us to. He has judged us worthy to be entrusted with the Good News. We do not try to please people, but to please God, who tests our motives examines our hearts.
You know very well that we did not come to you with flattering talk praise for selfish gain. We did not use words to cover up greed insatiable desire for wealth. God is our witness!
We did not try to get praise from anyone, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we could have made demands on you.
But we were gentle when we were with you, like a mother taking care of her children.
Having much affection for you, we were well pleased to impart the good news of God to you and also to share our lives with you. You have become very dear to us.
You may remember, brothers, our labor and hardship. We worked day and night that we would not burden any of you when we preached the good news of God to you.
You and God are witnesses, how devoutly and righteously, without blame, we behaved toward you who believe!
You know how we dealt with each one of you. It was like a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging and showing you.
You should walk worthily of God, who called you into his own kingdom and glory.
For this purpose we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, you accepted it, not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
You brothers became imitators of the congregations of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus. You also suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews.
They killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They did not please God and are contrary to all men.
They hindered us from speaking to the nations so that they may be saved. The result was that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
But we have been taken away from you for a short while. We have been taken away in person, not in spirit. We are all the more eager with great desire to see you.
We wanted to come to you. I, Paul, wanted to more than once and yet Satan hindered us.
Who is our hope, or joy, or crown of exultation? Is it not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming?
For you are our glory and joy!
When we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens.
So we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s fellow worker in the good news of Christ. He came to strengthen and encourage you concerning your faith.
We do not want anyone to be discouraged by these troubles. You know we were bound to suffer persecution.
When we were with you, we told you that we would suffer tribulation and affliction. It happened, as you know.
For this cause, when I could no longer bear it, I inquired about your faith. I feared that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain.
Timothy came from you to us, and brought us good news about your faith and love. We want you to have good memories of us always, and that you desire to see us just as we also desire to see you.
Brothers, your faith has comforted us. In all our trouble and suffering we are encouraged.
Now we live, if you persevere stand fast in the Lord.
What thanks can we render to God for you and for all the joy we have for your sakes before our God?
Night and day we pray exceedingly that we might see you in person, and might perfect restore repair that which is lacking in your faith.
May God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you.
May he resolutely strengthen your hearts without blame in holiness before God, our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his holy ones.
Furthermore, we encourage you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us how you ought to walk, and to please God, so you would abound more and more.
You know the commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
This is the will of God, for your sanctification holiness purification, that you should abstain from fornication.
Every one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honor,
not in the lust of sexual desire like the nations who do not know God.
Let no man defraud his brother in any matter. Jehovah is the avenger of this. We also have warned you and testified.
For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.
He therefore that rejects this, rejects not man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to us.
I do not need to write you about brotherly love. For God taught you to love one another.
Indeed, you do it toward all the brothers in all Macedonia: but we encourage you to increase more and more.
Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and mind your own business, and work with your hands, as we command you.
That way you may walk honestly in the eyes of those on the outside and lack nothing.
I do not want you to be ignorant brothers, concerning those who are asleep in death. You do not need to sorrow like others who have no hope.
If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, God will bring with him those who sleep in Jesus.
We tell you this by God’s Word, that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede those who are asleep.
For the Lord will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first.
We that are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so will we ever be with the Lord.
Comfort one another with these words.
You have no need that I write to you about the times and dates, brothers.
For you know perfectly that the "Day of Jehovah" will come like a thief in the night.
When they say, "Peace and security!" then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come to a pregnant woman. They will not escape.
You do not live in the dark. That day should not overtake you by surprise as a thief would.
You are all the children sons of light, and the children of the day. We are not of the night, not of darkness.
Therefore, let us not sleep like others do. But let us watch and be sober.
They that sleep do so in the night. They that get drunk are drunk in the night.
Let us be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love; and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
For God has not appointed us to experience his wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.
He died for us, that, whether we are awake in this life or sleep in death, we should live together with him.
Comfort each other and strengthen one another as you are doing.
We ask you, brothers, to appreciate those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you.
To esteem them very highly in love because of the work they do. And be at peace among yourselves.
We ask you brothers to warn the unruly and comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient with all men.
See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone. But follow that which is good, both among you, and to all men.
Rejoice always.
Pray without ceasing.
In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
Do not quench the Spirit.
Do not despise prophesying.
Prove all things; hold fast to what is good.
Abstain from all appearance of evil.
May the very God of peace completely sanctify you make you holy. I pray to God that your entire spiritual being, your mind and body, is preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Faithful is he who calls you. He will also make it happen.
Brothers, pray for us.
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
I charge you by the Lord that this letter is to be read to all the brothers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the people of the congregation in Thessalonica, who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
Our friends, we should thank God at all times for you. It is right for us to do so, because your faith is growing so much and the love each of you has for the other abounds toward each other.
That is why we boast rejoice have glory about you in the congregations of God. We boast rejoice have glory about the way you continue to endure and believe through all the persecutions and sufferings you experience.
All of this proves that God’s judgment is just, and as a result, you will become worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering.
It is a righteous thing for God to repay with affliction great suffering and distress those who afflict you.
You who are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire.
They will render vengeance to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus.
They will suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the Lord and from the glory of his might.
He will then come to be glorified in his holy ones, and to be marveled at by all those who believed, because our testimony to you was believed.
We pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and every work of faith with power.
May the name of our Lord Jesus be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Now we ask you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him,
do not get upset right away or alarmed when someone claims that we said through some spirit, conversation, or letter that the "Day of Jehovah" has already come.
Do not let anyone deceive you about this in any way. That day will not come unless apostasy a falling away from truth takes place first, and the man of lawlessness sin, the man of destruction, is revealed.
He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and object of worship. As a result, he seats himself in the sanctuary of God and declares promotes himself to be like God.
Do you remember that I repeatedly told you about these things when I was still with you?
There is something that keeps this from happening now, and you know what it is. At the proper time, then, the wicked one will appear.
The secret of evil lawlessness is even now at work. But there is one who restrains the evil till he is taken out of the way.
Then the evil lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will put him to death with the breath of his mouth, and destroy him by the manifestation brightness advent revelation of his coming. Greek: parousia: presence, return, being near
The evil lawless one will come with the power of Satan and perform all kinds of false signs and wonders.
He will use every kind of wicked deceit on those who will perish. They will perish because they did not welcome and love the truth so as to be saved.
So God dispatches the power of deceit error to work in them so that they are allowed to believe what is false.
Then everyone who did not believe the truth, but was delighted with wickedness, will be condemned.
We always have to thank God for you, brothers. Jehovah loves you and we thank God that in the beginning he chose you to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
It was for this he called you through our good news. This is so you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the precepts Greek: paradosis: traditions of doctrines, teachings handed down you were taught by word of mouth or by letter from us.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort and good hope by grace,
comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good word and work.
Finally, brothers, pray for us that the word of God will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it did also with you.
Pray that we may be delivered rescued from perverse and evil men, for not all have faith.
But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience steadfastness of Christ.
Our friends, we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from all believers who walk disorderly and who do not follow the instructions that we gave them.
You know what you must do to imitate us. We lived a disciplined life among you.
We did not eat anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, we worked hard and struggled night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.
It is not because we do not have the right, but to make ourselves an example for you to imitate us.
While we were with you, we used to tell you: "Whoever refuses to work is not allowed to eat."
We say this because we hear that there are people among you who are lazy and who do nothing except meddle in other people’s business.
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command and warn them to lead orderly lives and work to earn their own living.
Brothers, do not grow weary of doing good.
If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be put to shame.
Do not regard him as an enemy. Admonish him as a brother.
Now may the Lord of peace always grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope,
to Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
As I urged you to stay at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that you might command certain men not to teach strange doctrines.
They should not pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These myths false stories fabrications and genealogies stimulate questions and speculation. They do not enhance the administration of God that is by faith.
But the objective is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith without hypocrisy.
Some have turned aside to vain talk by deviating from these things.
They want to be teachers of the Law even though they do not know what they are talking about. They do not understand what they say or what they confidently affirm.
But we know that the Law is good, if a man uses it legitimately.
Knowing this, that Law is not made for a righteous person. It is for the lawless and unruly, the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, and for manslayers.
It is for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and everything else that is contrary to the sound teaching.
Sound teaching doctrine is according to the good news of the glory of the blessed happy God. This was committed to my trust.
I thank him that enabled me and counted me faithful, appointing me to his service, Christ Jesus our Lord.
I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a violent aggressor. I was shown mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
Faithful is the saying, and worthy of acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.
For this I obtained mercy, which in me as the foremost sinner Jesus Christ might show his long-suffering. This is for an example to those who should later believe in him for eternal life.
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
I entrust this command to you, Timothy, my son. It is in accordance with the prophecies that were previously made. They do apply to you, and with them you may fight the good fight.
Keep the faith and maintain a good conscience! Some have rejected these things and have suffered shipwreck to their faith.
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I handed them over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.
I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,
They should be made for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.
It is God’s desire that all men have salvation and come to the full precise accurate correct knowledge Greek: epignosis: recognition, discernment of the truth.
There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
He gave himself as a ransom for all. A witness was to be given at the right time.
Because of this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle. What I say is true, not false, and I am a teacher of the nations in the true faith.
I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or argument.
Likewise I want women to be adorned in modest clothing, with modesty and soundness of mind; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly clothes;
but that which becomes a woman professing godliness through good works.
Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.
I do not permit a woman to teach or have dominion over a man, but to remain quiet.
Adam was first formed and then Eve.
Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.
She will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.
Faithful is the saying: If a man seeks the office of overseer, he desires a good work.
The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach;
not addicted to wine, not quarrelsome; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;
one who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all seriousness;
if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the congregation of God?
He should not be a new believer, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the Devil.
He must have a good reputation with those outside the congregation, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.
Ministerial servants should likewise be men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain.
They should maintain the secret of the faith with a clear conscience.
Let these be tested first. Then let them serve as servants, if they are blameless.
Women in like manner must be serious, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
For they that have served well as servants gain to themselves a good standing and great confidence boldness of speech in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly,
though if I am delayed, so that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the household of God, which is the congregation of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
The secret of godliness is great and it is without controversy. ‘ He Jesus Christ was manifested revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, and seen by angels. He preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, and received up in glory. ’
The Spirit explicitly says that some will fall away from the faith truth in later times. Spirits and doctrines of demons will seduce them,
through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron.
They will forbid marrying, and command to abstain from food, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.
This is because it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
If you tell the brothers about these things, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed until now.
Refuse false stories and old wives' fables. Train yourself with godliness in mind.
Bodily exercise is profitable for a little. However, godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of the life that is to come.
Faithful and worthy of full acceptance is the statement.
This is why we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
Command and teach these things.
Let no man look down on your youth. Be an example to the believers in speech and conduct, in love, in faith and chasteness.
Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Do not neglect the spiritual gift in you. It was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.
Be diligent and think about these things. Give yourself wholly to them. That way your progress may be apparent to all.
Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching. Continue in these things. When you do this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.
Do not rebuke censure criticize an elder, but appeal to him as a father, the younger men as brothers.
Treat the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with much honor.
Honor widows that are truly widows.
But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show righteousness towards their own family, and to repay their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in supplications and prayers day and night.
But she that gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
Command these things that they may be without reproach.
If any do not provide for his own, and specially his own household, he denies the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
Let a widow be put on the list if she is under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
having a good reputation for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the holy ones, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
Refuse younger widows: for when their sexual impulses come between them and Christ, they desire to marry.
They have judgment, because they have rejected their first pledge.
They also learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but gossipers and busybodies, speaking things that they should not.
I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.
Some have already turned aside after Satan.
If any woman that believes has dependant widows, she must assist them and not let the congregation be burdened. Then it can assist those who are actually widows.
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
For the scripture said: "You must not muzzle the bull while he is threshing. The workman is worthy of his wages."
Do not offer an accusation against an elder, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.
Reprove the sinner in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these principles without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
Do not lay your hands hastily on any man, neither be a partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.
Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your many infirmities.
Some men's sins are known publicly, leading to judgment; and some men’s sin becomes known later.
In like manner some good works are known publicly, and other works will be known, for they cannot be kept hidden.
Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the teachings will not be blasphemed.
Do not despise your believing masters, because they are brothers. Serve them, because they who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
If any man teaches a different doctrine, and does not consent to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine that is according to godliness,
he is proud, knows nothing, has a morbid interest in questions and disputes about words, which leads to envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,
frictions between men corrupted in mind and lacking in truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.
Godliness with contentment is great gain.
We brought nothing into the world and we can carry nothing out.
We should be content with having food and covering.
Those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts. These draw men into ruin and destruction.
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some by longing for it have been led away from the faith. They have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
But you, O man of God, run from these things. Pursue set your heart on righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience and meekness.
Fight the good fight of the faith! Lay hold on everlasting life! You were called and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession:
Keep the commandment without spot and without reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
The blessed and only Potentate Sovereign Authority will make him appear in his own appointed time. For he is the King of kings and Lord of lords.
Only God has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light. No man has seen him, nor can see him. To him be honor and power forever. Amen.
Command those who are rich in this present system not to be high-minded arrogant, not to have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.
They should do good works and be rich in good works, that they are ready to distribute, willing to communicate.
They store up for them a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life that is life indeed.
O Timothy, guard that which is committed to you. Turn away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from opposition and from false "knowledge."
Some have professed this knowledge and erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
to Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my forefathers did, that without ceasing, I remember you in my prayers, day and night.
I greatly desire to see you, being mindful of your tears, for this will fill me with joy.
I am mindful of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.
For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God that is in you because of the laying on of my hands.
God has not given us a spirit of timidity fear, but of power and love and discipline.
Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me his prisoner. Join me in suffering for the good news according to the power of God.
God has saved us and called us with a holy calling. This is not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace that was granted us in Christ Jesus, from all eternity.
The appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus revealed this. Jesus abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the good news.
I was appointed to be a messenger of this good news, an apostle, and a teacher.
It is for this reason that I suffer these things. But I am still full of confidence, because I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to keep safe until that day what he has entrusted to me.
Hold firmly to the true words that I taught you, as the example for you to follow. Remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus.
Through the power of the Holy Spirit, who lives in us. Keep guard obey preserve the good things that have been entrusted to you.
You know that all that are in Asia turned away from me. This includes Phygelus and Hermogenes.
The Lord grants mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains.
When he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me.
May the Lord grant him to find the mercy of God in that day, and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, you know very well.
You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace loving-kindness that is in Christ Jesus.
What you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well.
You must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
No soldier entangles himself in the affairs of this life. That way, he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.
If anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.
The hard-working farmer should be first to receive his share of the crops.
Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
Remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. He is a descendant of David, according to my good news.
I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal. But the word of God is not imprisoned.
For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.
This is a faithful saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him.
If we endure, we will also reign with Him. If we deny him, He will deny us!
If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny himself.
Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to argue about words. This is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
Be diligent to be presented approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.
But avoid worldly and empty discussion, for it will lead to further ungodliness.
This kind of talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus.
These men have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.
The foundation of God stands firm having this seal: "Jehovah knows those who belong to him," and: "Everyone who names the name of Jehovah is to abstain from wickedness."
Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.
If anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
Flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord with a clean heart.
But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing they produce quarrels controversy fighting.
The Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind gentle to all, able to teach, and patient when wronged.
He should instruct those who oppose using meekness. Perhaps God will give them repentance that they may know the truth.
They should come to their senses out of the snare of the Devil. He has taken them captive and they do his will.
Know this also that in the last days perilous dangerous times will come.
For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous lovers of money, arrogant, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful ungrateful, unholy,
unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, despisers of those who are good,
traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
having a form of godliness, but denying its power. Stay away from people like this!
Among them are those who creep into houses and lead captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away with various lusts.
They are constantly learning, and never able to grasp the knowledge of the truth.
And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, rejected concerning the faith,
they will make no progress; for their foolishness will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
You carefully follow my teaching in conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, and patience,
and also persecutions and sufferings. The things that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. Out of them the Lord delivered me.
Yes, and all who would live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
But evil men and impostors will become worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
Continue in the things you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.
From childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to make you wise to salvation through faith that is in Christ Jesus.
God inspired all Scripture! It is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness. Greek: theopneustos: God-breathed
Thus the man of God may be completely equipped for every good work.
I solemnly charge you in the sight presence of God, and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.
For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine. Having their ears tickled, they will accumulate teachers who follow after their own lusts.
They will turn their ears away from the truth, and turn aside to myths fiction.
Be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist preacher of the good news, and fulfill your ministry.
I am already being offered poured out as an offering, and the time of my departure has come.
I have fought the good fight! I have finished the course! I have kept the faith!
The crown of righteousness is laid up for me. The Lord, the righteous judge, will give it to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing manifestation.
Do your best to come to me shortly.
For Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
Only Luke is with me. Take Mark with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.
I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
When you come, bring the books, parchments, and the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus.
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: God will render to him according to his works.
You should also beware of him, for he intensely opposed our words.
At first no one defended me. They all abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.
But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the people of the nations might hear. I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion Satan the Devil great danger.
The Lord will deliver me from every evil work. He will save me to his heavenly kingdom. To him is the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus.
Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.
The Lord be with your spirit mental disposition attitude. Grace be with you.
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness.
It is in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal.
In his own time he made his word known through the message that was entrusted to me according to the commandment of God our Savior.
To Titus, my true child sharing a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
I left you in Crete for this purpose, that you should correct the things that were defective, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave you orders.
A blameless man will be the husband of one wife. He will have children that believe and who are not accused of violence and disobedience.
The overseer must be blameless as God's steward. He must not be self-willed, not prone to anger, not a brawler, and not violent quarrelsome pugnacious, not greedy of dishonest gain.
but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to reprove refute rebuke those who contradict.
There are many unruly rebellious men, vain talkers, and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision.
They must be stopped. Their mouths must be shut up, for they subvert entire households. They teach things that should not be taught, for the sake of dishonest gain.
One of them, a prophet of their own, said: "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."
This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure. Both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
They profess that they know God; but deny him by their works! They are detestable, disobedient, and not approved for any good work.
Teach sound doctrine.
Aged men should be temperate, serious, sound in mind, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.
Aged women likewise should be reverent in behavior and teachers of that which is good. They should not be slanderers nor enslaved to too much wine.
They may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God will not be defamed dishonored.
Urge the younger men to be sound in mind.
Be an example of good works in all things, showing no corruption in your doctrine.
Have sound speech that cannot be condemned so the man opposing us may be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us.
Servants should to be in subjection to their masters overseers employers. They should please them in all things and not talk back.
They should not steal from them, but should show good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
For the grace divine influence of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all men,
instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present age world period of time.
Look for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of the great God. And look for our Savior, Jesus Christ.
He Jesus Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify a people for himself, who are special people, zealous for good works.
Speak and exhort and reprove these things with all authority. Let no man despise you.
Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do every good work,
to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
When the kindness of God our Savior, and his love toward man, appeared,
not by works done in righteousness, which we did, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration restoration spiritual rebirth and renewing renovation of the Holy Spirit.
He poured Spirit out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior.
Being justified by his grace loving kindness, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
You should avoid foolish arguing and dissentions, questioning; and genealogies, and arguing about law, for they are unprofitable and vain.
A divisive and dissentious man should be admonished, and after two times have nothing to do with that man.
You know that man sins and is perverted. He is self-condemned.
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, give diligence to come to me at Nicopolis where I will winter.
Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey quickly and see that they lack nothing.
Help our people learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they are not unfruitful.
All that are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
and to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the congregation in your house:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers.
I hear about your love, and about the faith you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the holy ones.
May the fellowship of your faith operate in the knowledge of every good thing that is in you for Jesus Christ.
For I have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother.
I have all boldness in Christ to tell you what is appropriate.
Because of love I appeal to you, since I am Paul, the aged. I am also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment.
He was once worthless to you, but now is useful to you and me.
I send him back to you, like sending my heart.
I would have kept him with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the good news.
Without your agreement I would do nothing. Your goodness should not be out of necessity, but of free will.
Perhaps he was separated from you for a season, that you should have him forever.
He is no longer a servant. He is more than a servant. He is a beloved brother, especially to me, but also to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
If you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.
But if he has wronged you and owes you anything at all, charge this to me.
I Paul write with my own hand. I will repay. I do not say that you owe your own self life to me.
Yes, brother, let me have joy in you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
I have confidence in your obedience. I write you, knowing that you will do beyond what I say.
Prepare a lodging for me. I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.
So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit mental disposition attitude. Amen.
Long ago on many occasions and in many ways God spoke to our fathers through the prophets.
He has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, through whom he made the ages Greek: aion: ages of time, perpetuity, worlds, generations, human entities.
God’s Son is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his being. He sustains all things by his powerful word. After Jesus purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
He has become better than the angels and has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.
To which of the angels did God ever say at any time: "You are my son; this day I have begotten you"? And again: "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?
And again: when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says: "Let all the angels of God pay him homage."
Of the angels he says: "He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
But he says to the Son: "God is your throne forever and ever. Your throne, Oh God-like one, is forever.: A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.
"You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions."
And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands.
"They will perish but you remain. They will all grow old like a garment.
"Just as a coat you fold them up, and they will be changed: but you are the same, and your years will never run out."
To which of the angels did he say at any time: "Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool"?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for those who will be heirs of salvation?
Pay close attention to the things heard so we do not drift away.
If the word spoken through angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward penalty.
How shall we escape, if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first presented by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him.
God also testified about it with signs, wonders, and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit given according to his will.
He did not subject the world to come that we speak about to the angels.
But a certain witness has given proof, saying: "What is man, that you are mindful of him? Or what is the son of man that you take care of him?
"You made him a little lower than the angels for a little while. Greek: brachus, short time You crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of your hands.
"You put all things in subjection under his feet." You subjected all things to him and left nothing that is not subject to him. Now we do not see yet all things in subjection to him.
We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honor for suffering death. By the grace of God he tasted death for every man.
It was appropriate that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, should bring many sons to glory, to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through suffering.
Both he who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all from one. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them "brothers".
He says: "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of the congregation I will sing praises to you."
And again: "I will put my trust in him." And again: "Behold, the children that Jehovah has given me."
Since the "children" are partakers of flesh and blood, he also took part of the same things, that through death he might destroy him that had the power to cause death, Satan the Devil.
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
He does not help the angels, but he helps the seed of Abraham.
This means that he had to become like his "brothers" in every way, in order to be their faithful and merciful High Priest in his service to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice pay atonement to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
Since he has suffered and was tested in every way; he is able to help those who are being tested.
Holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.
He was faithful to Him who appointed him, just as Moses was in His entire house.
He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses. This is because the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
Every house has a builder. God is the builder of all things.
Indeed Moses was faithful in His house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken afterwards.
Christ was faithful as a Son over God’s house. We are His house if we hold on to our courage confidence and rejoice speak boldly about our hope until the end.
The Holy Spirit says: "Today if you will hear his voice,
"do not harden your hearts and be stubborn like those who tested me in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
"Your forefathers examined inspected scrutinized me by proving testing me. And they saw my works for forty years.
"I was disgusted angry with this generation, and said: ‘ They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways. ’
"So I swore in my anger: ‘ They will not enter into my rest. ’"
Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you develop a wicked heart lacking faith and turning away departing from the living God.
Encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called "Today," that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we have become companions partners with Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of our firm trust to the end.
Scripture says: "Today if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts. Do not be stubborn like those who rebelled."
Who were they who heard God and rebelled? All who came out of Egypt with Moses rebelled.
With whom was he disgusted for forty years? He was disgusted and angry with those who sinned and died in the desert.
Who did God swear would never enter his rest? He was talking about those who did not obey him.
We see that they could not enter in on account of a lack of faith unbelief disobedience.
While the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear that one of you might come up short and not enter.
Indeed, we have had good news presented to us. They also had it. But the word that was heard did not benefit them because they were not united in faith by what was heard.
We who believe enter into the rest. As God said: "I swore in my anger: ‘ They shall not enter into my rest. ’" Yet God’s works were completed from the foundation of the world.
Somewhere God said this about the seventh day: "God rested on the seventh day from all his works."
Again: "They shall not enter into my rest."
It remains for some to enter into it. Those who first received the good news did not enter in because they did not obey and lacked faith.
He determines a certain day by saying through David: "Today," after so long a time; just as it was said before, "Today, if you will listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts."
If Joshua had given them rest, he God would not have spoken afterwards about another day.
There remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
He who enters into his rest also rests from his own works, just as God did from his.
Let us do our utmost to enter into that rest. Let no one fall into the same pattern of disobedience by not obeying the word.
The Word of God is alive and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It separates the physical person from the spiritual person, of both joints and marrow. And it can discern judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. All things are uncovered and laid bare before him. We must account to him.
We have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, so let us hold fast our confession.
We do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our infirmities weaknesses. He was tested in all things like ourselves. Yet he was without sin!
Let us approach the throne of grace loving-kindness with confidence, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for help in time of need.
Every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God. He may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
He is able to exercise compassion towards the ignorant and those going astray, since he is also subject to weakness.
That is why he must offer sacrifices, for his own and for the people’s sins.
No one takes this honor upon himself. He is called by God, even as Aaron was.
Also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest. It was God who said to him: "You are my Son; I today have become your father."
As he said in another place:" You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
In the days of his life on earth, when he Christ offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death, and was heard because of his godly reverence.
Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.
Being made perfect, he became the source cause channel conduit pathway facilitator of eternal salvation to all who obey him.
He was called by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
We have many things to say about him and it is hard to explain it to you, for you are dull of hearing slow to learn.
At this time you should be teachers. But you need someone to teach you again from the beginning the elementary truths from the Word of God. You need milk, not solid food.
Everyone who drinks milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
But solid food belongs to mature people. It belongs to those who by reason of use have their senses trained to know the difference between good and evil.
Therefore leaving the elementary truths of the doctrine of Christ let us move on to maturity. Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God.
We should not repeat the basic teachings about baptisms, and of the laying on of hands setting apart for holy tasks, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
We will do this if God permits.
Those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
and have tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
if they shall fall away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance. This is because they personally impale the Son of God again, and expose him to public shame.
The earth that drinks in the rain that comes upon it, and brings forth vegetation for those by whom it was cultivated, receives blessing from God.
That which bears thorns and briars is rejected, and is near to being cursed. It ends up being burned.
Even though we speak this way, beloved, we are convinced that you will have better things, things that belong to salvation.
For God is not unrighteous unjust to forget your work and the love you showed for his name. You ministered to the holy ones and continue to minister.
We desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope down to the end.
We desire that you are not lazy, but follow those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
When God made a promise to Abraham, he could swear by no one greater then himself, so he swore by himself.
He said: "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."
After waiting patiently, Abraham received the promise.
Men swear by someone greater then themselves: and an oath for confirmation to them puts an end to the problem.
When God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he confirmed it with an oath.
God did this to offer encouragement so we may rely on the hope offered to us. We have taken refuge in that hope and it is impossible for God to lie. These two things can never be changed.
We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of life. It is a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain.
That is where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.
Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything to him. He was first of all, by translation of his name, "King of Righteousness," and then he was also ruler of Salem, which means, "King of Peace."
He was without father or mother or genealogy, and neither had beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he continues as a priest forever.
See how great he was! Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.
The descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the Law to take tithes from the people. This is from their brothers, for these are descended from Abraham.
But this man does not have their genealogy. He received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
It is beyond dispute that the superior blesses the inferior.
In this instance mortal men receive tithes, in the other by the one of whom it is testified that he lives.
One might even say that Levi, the priest who takes the tenth from the people, gave his tenth through Abraham.
He was still in the loins of his ancestor not yet born when Melchizedek met him.
If perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood, for under it the people received the Law, what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, instead of one named after the order of Aaron?
The priesthood was changed, and therefore it is necessary to also change the Law.
The one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
It is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
This is clear if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
He would become such, not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
For it is announced: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
The former commandment was set aside because it was weak and useless.
The Law could not make anything perfect. A better hope has been provided through which we can draw near to God.
It was not without an oath. Others were made priest without any oath.
He became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "Jehovah has sworn and he will feel no regret, you are a priest forever."
Jesus became the guarantee of a better covenant.
There have been many priests. This is because they have been prevented from continuing by death.
He continues forever and therefore has his priesthood without change.
He is able to save completely those who approach God through him, because he is always alive to intercede for them.
Such a high priest as this was suitable for us. He is holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and higher than the heavens.
He does not have a day-by-day need as the high priests do, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then for those of the people. He sacrificed for sin once for all when he offered up himself.
The Law appoints men as high priests who have weakness. But the oath that came after the Law appointed the Son who is perfect forever.
Here is a summary of the things we are discussing: We have this kind of high priest. He sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven.
He is a minister of the Holy Place and of the true Tabernacle, built by Jehovah and not man.
Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. It is necessary to have something to offer.
If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.
The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. It is the same as it was with Moses. When he was about to build the sacred tent, God told him: "Be sure to make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain."
Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry. The covenant that he arranged between God and his people is a better one, because it is based on promises of better things.
If there had been nothing wrong with the first covenant, there would not have been a need for a second one.
God finds fault with his people and said to them: "‘ The time is coming, ’ ’ says Jehovah, ‘ when I will draw up a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.
"‘ It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They were not faithful to the covenant I made with them, and so I paid no attention to them.
"‘ This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, ’ ’ said Jehovah: ‘ I will put my teachings laws in their mind, I will write them upon their hearts deep thought understanding. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
"‘ They will not teach a neighbor or brother saying: "Know Jehovah." All will know me from the little one among them to the great among them.
"‘ I will forgive their wickedness and I will remember their sins no more. ’"
By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one old obsolete. That which grows old and aged will soon disappear.
The first covenant had ordinances for divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.
A tabernacle was set up. The first room was called "the Holy Place." It contained the lamp stand and table and the consecrated bread.
Beyond the second curtain was a room called "the Most Holy Place."
It had a golden incense burner. The Ark of the Covenant was completely covered with gold. It contained the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant.
The cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat were above the Ark. Now is not the time to speak in detail.
When these things are prepared, the priests enter the outer room often to carry on their services.
Only the high priest enters the inner room. Once a year he entered with blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people.
The Holy Spirit revealed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the tent was still in use.
This is a symbol that points to the present time. It means that the offerings and animal sacrifices presented to God cannot make the worshiper’s heart perfect,
since they have to do only with food, drink, and various purification ceremonies. These are all outward rules, which apply only until the time comes to change them for something better.
Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here. He also went into a much better tent that is not made by humans and does not belong to this creation.
He went once and forever into the Most Holy Place having eternal salvation. It is not with the blood of goats and young bulls, but with his blood.
The blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes from the burning of a young cow, sprinkled on the unclean made them outwardly clean.
The blood of Christ did even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself without blemish to God and cleansed your conscience from dead works. Now we can serve worship the living God.
For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant. A death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant. Those called may receive the promise of everlasting inheritance.
A will is used for a person who is dead. It becomes effective only when the person dies.
A will is in force after a person dies. Otherwise it is not in effect at all while the one who provided it lives.
The first covenant was dedicated with blood.
When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
He said: "This is the blood of the covenant that God has presented to you."
He sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of service.
Almost all things are by the Law purified with blood. There is no forgiveness unless blood is poured out.
It was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these. But the heavenly things should be cleansed with better sacrifices than these.
Christ has not entered into the Holy Place made with human hands. This is a copy of the true one. He has entered into heaven to appear before the presence of God for us.
Neither should he offer himself as the high priest enters into the Holy Place every year with blood of others.
Otherwise he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. He has presented himself once at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
It is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:
So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. He will appear the second time without sin to those who look to him for their salvation.
The Law is a shadow of the good things to come. It is not the actual things. The continual yearly sacrifices can never make those who worship perfect.
If it could, it would cease to be offered. Once the worshipers were cleansed they would have no awareness of sin anymore.
These sacrifices are an annual reminder of sin.
It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins.
When Christ came into the world he said: "‘ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but you have prepared a body for me.
"‘ You have no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. ’
"Then I said: ‘ I have come in the scroll of the book. It is written about me, to do your will, O God. ’"
Then he said: "You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin;" which are offered by the Law.
He also said: "I come to do your will, O God." He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
We are sanctified by his "will" through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Every priest stands daily, serving and offering time after time the same sacrifices. Yet they can never take away sins.
But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,
waiting until his enemies are placed as a stool for his feet.
With one offering he has perfected those who are sanctified forever.
The Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after that he said:
"‘ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, ’ ’ says Jehovah; ‘ I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them. ’
"I will not remember their sins and unrighteousness."
Where there is forgiveness for these, there is no more offering for sin.
Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
by a new and living way, which he consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,
having a high priest over the house of God,
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised.
Let us consider one another to encourage love and good works:
Not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and even more, as you see the day approaching.
If we continue to practice deliberately persist in sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins.
But there remains a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fiery indignation, which will devour God’s enemies.
He that despised Moses’ Law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.
What about those who despise the Son of God? Those who treat as a cheap thing the blood of God’s covenant that purified them from sin? Those who insult the Spirit of grace? Think how much worse the punishment they deserve will be!
We know who said: "Vengeance is mine; I will repay"; and who also said, "Jehovah will judge his people."
It is a dreadful terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Remember the former days in which, after being enlightened, you endured great struggle with afflictions.
You were at times publicly insulted and mistreated. Other times you were ready to join those who were being treated in this way.
You shared the sufferings of prisoners. When all your belongings were seized, you endured your loss gladly. This is because you knew that you possessed something much better, which would last forever.
Do not lose your courage confidence boldness. It brings a great reward with it.
You need to persevere in order to do the will of God and receive what he promises.
"In just a little while, he who is coming will come. He will not delay!"
"My righteous people will live by faith. If any of them turn back, I will not be pleased with them."
We are not people who turn back and are destroyed. Instead, we have faith and are saved.
Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, and evidence of things not seen.
God approved of the men of old because of their faith.
By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the Word of God. The visible has been made out of things that were not visible.
By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. Through this he was commended as righteous. God testified about his gifts. Thus through faith he still speaks even though he is dead.
By faith Enoch was moved transferred removed so that he would not see death. He was not found, because God had moved him away. Before he was moved away he saw that he had pleased God well.
Without faith it is impossible to please God. He who comes to God must believe that he is and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not seen as yet, moved with godly respect. He prepared an ark to save his house. By his faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith.
By faith, when Abraham was called, he obeyed. He went to a place that he was to receive for an inheritance. He went even though he did not know where he was going.
By faith he became an alien in the Promised Land. It was not his land. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob. They were heirs with him of the same promise.
He looked for the city having real foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
By faith Sarah received strength to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who promised.
This was to come from one man and him as good as dead. There were born children, as many as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as uncountable as the sand by the seashore.
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar. They confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
Those who say such things declare that they are seeking a country of their own.
If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they came, they would have had opportunity to return.
They desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Because of this, God is not ashamed to be called their God. He has prepared a city for them!
By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. He that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only-begotten son!
It was said: "In Isaac your descendants will be called."
Abraham reasoned that God is able to raise him from the dead. So he figured he would receive him back.
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph. He worshipped while leaning upon the top of his staff.
By faith Joseph, when his end was near, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel. Then he gave orders concerning his bones.
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents. They saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.
By faith Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.
He chose to share the bad treatment with the people of God, rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
He considered the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. He looked intently respectfully for the payment of the reward.
By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king. He endured, by seeing him who is invisible.
By faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. The Egyptians tried and were drowned.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.
By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with the disobedient, after she welcomed the spies in peace.
What more shall I say? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,
who through faith subdued kingdoms, affected righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, and turned to flight foreign armies.
Women received their dead by a resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection:
And others had trial of cruel mocking and scourging and bonds and imprisonment.
They were stoned, they were sawed in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented.
The world was not worthy of them! They wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, did not receive the promise.
God provided something better for us that they might not be made perfect without us.
A great cloud of witnesses surround us. Therefore let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that easily entangles us. Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.
Look to consider without distractions Jesus, the Leader Predecessor and Finisher Perfecter of our faith. He despised the shame. He endured the stake for the joy that was set before him. Then he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Consider him who endured such contrary talk by sinners against him. You should not get tired and give up in your mind heart.
You have not yet resisted by shedding blood in your striving against sin.
You have forgotten the exhortation that reasons with you as to sons: "My son, do not despise regard lightly discipline from Jehovah and do not lose heart when he corrects you.
"Jehovah disciplines those he loves. In fact he scourges every son child he receives."
God deals with you like children. Endure discipline instruction training. Who is the child whom a father does not discipline?
If you are without discipline, you are illegitimate children, and not sons.
Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh that corrected us, and we gave them respect. Shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?
They disciplined us for a few days for their own pleasure. He disciplines for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
Now no discipline for the present seems to be joyous. In fact it seems grievous! Nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained.
Lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees.
Make straight paths for your feet. Let that which is lame be turned out of the way, but rather let it be healed.
Pursue peace and holiness with all people, for no man will see the Lord without it.
See that no one misses the grace of God; that no bitter root spring up to cause trouble and defile many.
Let no one become immoral or unspiritual like Esau. He sold his birthright for a single meal!
Afterward, you know, he wanted to receive inherit his father’s blessing. He was turned back, because he could not find any way to change what he had done. He was in tears when he looked for it.
You have not come to a mountain that can be touched, to Mount Sinai with its blazing fire, the darkness and the gloom, the storm.
You have not come to the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of a voice. When the people heard the voice, they begged not to hear another word.
They could not bear the order: "If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned."
The sight was so terrible formidable fearful that Moses said: "I am full of fear and trembling."
You have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads thousands of thousands of angels,
to the general assembly and congregation of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just righteous holy men made perfect mature having all needed qualities.
You have come to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks in a better way than the blood of Abel.
Be careful, then, and do not refuse to hear him who speaks. Those who refused to hear the one who gave the divine message on earth did not escape. How much less shall we escape then, if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven!
His voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised: "I will once more shake not only the earth but also heaven."
The words "once more" plainly show that the created things will be shaken and removed, so that the things that cannot be shaken will remain.
Let us be thankful, because we will receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Let us be grateful and worship serve intensely adore God in a way that will please him, with reverence and awe.
Our God is a destroying consuming fire.
You should continue to love one another as brothers.
Show hospitality to strangers, for some have entertained angels without knowing it.
Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them. Remember those who are suffering, as though you were suffering as they are.
Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled: for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.
You should be free from the love of money. Be content with what you have, for he has said: "I will not leave you. I will not forsake you."
So that with good confidence courage we say: "Jehovah is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do to me?"
Remember those who are taking the lead among you, men that spoke the Word of God to you. Consider their behavior and imitate their faith.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Do not be carried away by varied different and strange teachings. It is good that the heart is established by grace and not by food. Those who are occupied by them are not benefited.
We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.
Jesus suffered outside the gate that he might sanctify the people through his own blood.
Let us therefore go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
We do not have a city that continues. We seek after the city that is to come.
Let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God through him Jesus, that is, the fruit of lips that make confession give thanks and offer praise to his name.
Do not forget neglect to do good and to communicate fellowship share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Obey those who lead you. Submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your lives and must account for this. Obey them that their work may be a joy and not a burden; that would be without gain for you.
Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience. And we wish to live honorably in all things.
I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus,
make you perfect mature in every good thing. May you do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
I urge you, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation. I have written to you in few words.
Do you know that brother Timothy has been released? If he comes shortly, I will see you.
Greet all those who rule over you, and all the holy ones. They in Italy greet you.
Grace be with you all. Amen.
This letter is from James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to the twelve tribes that are scattered.
Count it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials.
Know that the testing of your faith produces patience endurance.
Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be mature, complete, and lacking in nothing.
If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God. He gives to all generously and without reproach and it will be given to him.
However he must ask in faith, not doubting: for he who doubts is like a surging wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.
Do not let that man think that he will receive anything from God.
A double-minded man is unstable inconsistent in all his ways.
Let the brother of humble circumstances glory in his high position exaltation.
But the rich must be glad when God humbles them. This is because they will wither like wildflowers and pass away.
The sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. The flower falls off and its beauty perishes. So also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits.
The man who endures under trial is blessed. For when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him.
Let no man say when he is tempted: " God tempts me. " God cannot be tempted with evil, and he tempts entices tests trys no one.
Each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his evil desire lust. He is enticed allured.
Then evil desires, when conceived, give birth to sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.
Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights truth and spiritual purity, with whom there is no variation. He does not change like shifting shadows.
Using his own will, he gave us birth through the word of truth. This way we would be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
You know this, my beloved brothers. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
The anger of man does not promote the righteousness of God.
Therefore get rid of all filthiness and wickedness. Receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save you.
Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, who deceive themselves.
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror.
He sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was.
But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continues, being not a hearer who forgets but a doer who works, this man will be blessed in what he does.
If any man thinks he is religious, while he does not control his tongue but deceives his heart, this man's religion is vain worthless useless.
Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to care for the fatherless persons and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.
My brothers, keep the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. Do not favor one person over the other.
A man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in shabby clothes comes into your synagogue.
You pay special attention to the one wearing the fine clothes, and say: " Sit here in a good place. " Then you say to the poor man: " Stand there, " or " Sit under my footstool. "
Do not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts.
Listen, my dearly beloved brothers! Did God choose poor people in the world to be rich in faith and to receive the kingdom he promised to those who love him?
You have dishonored the poor man. Do the rich oppress you, and personally drag you into court?
Do they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
When you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture: " You shall love your neighbor as yourself, " you do well.
But when you show partiality you commit sin. The law then convicts you as transgressors.
Whoever obeys the whole law and yet stumbles in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
For he who said: " Do not commit adultery, " also said: " Do not murder " Greek: phoneuo: kill, slay, murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
You should speak and act as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.
For judgment is without mercy to him who shows no mercy. And mercy triumphs over judgment.
What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith but he does not have works? Can that faith save him?
If a brother or sister is without clothes and in lack of daily food,
and one of you says to them: " Go in peace, be warmed and filled; " and yet you do not give them food and clothing, what good is it?
Even so, faith without works is dead. It is alone and by itself!
A man will say: " You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works. "
You believe that there is one God. You do well: the demons also believe, and shudder.
Are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless barren lifeless?
Was Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
You see that faith acted with his works, and works made faith perfect complete.
The scripture was fulfilled which says: " Abraham believed Jehovah and it was reckoned imputed considered credited to him for righteousness. " He was called "Jehovah’s friend ".
You see that a man is justified declared and pronounced righteous by works, and not by faith alone.
Rahab the harlot was justified by her works. When she received the messengers she sent them out another way.
Just as the body without the spirit is dead; even so faith without works is dead.
Many of you should not be teachers, my brothers. You know that we will receive a heavier stricter judgment.
We all stumble in many things. If any do not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to restrain control the whole body.
We put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us. We guide their whole bodies.
Look at ships. They are large and are driven by rough winds. Yet a very small rudder can control them, wherever the captain wills.
The tongue also is a little member. It boasts great things. Consider how great a forest fire a small fire kindles!
The tongue is like fire, the place of iniquity among our members. It defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of our life. It is set ablaze like the ever-burning fires in the Valley of Hinnom Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction.
Every kind of beast and bird, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.
But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil. It is full of deadly poison.
We bless Jehovah, the Father, with it. Then we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.
Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth! My brothers, these things should not be.
Does the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?
Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine produce figs? Neither can salt water yield sweet.
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his works are from meekness because of wisdom.
If you have bitter jealousy envy and greedy ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and lie against the truth.
This wisdom is not a wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish.
For where jealousy and selfishness are, there is confusion and every evil deed.
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, without discord partiality, without hypocrisy.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.
What causes wars and fighting among you? Is the cause of fighting your sensual lusts for pleasure that battle within you?
You lust, and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain! You fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask.
You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly with bad motives that you may spend it on your pleasures.
Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity hatred hostility toward God? Whoever would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
Or do you think the scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the attitude of the heart mental disposition that he induced to live in us cause us to envy?
But he gives more grace. The scripture said, " God resists the proud, but gives grace loving-kindness to the humble. "
Be subject to God! Resist Satan the Devil and he will flee from you.
Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded uncertain doubter skeptic.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
Humble yourselves in the presence of God, and he will exalt you.
Brothers, do not speak against each other. He who speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law. If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
Only one is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you that you judge your neighbor?
Come now, you that say, " Today or tomorrow we will go to this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and make profit. "
You do not know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a vapor puff of air that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
You should say, " If God wills, we should both live, and do this or that. "
You glory in your conceit. Such glory is evil.
He that knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin.
Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
Your gold and your silver are rusted. Their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up your treasure in the last days.
Behold, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which are held back by you, cry out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of Jehovah of Hosts.
You lived in luxury on the earth, and take your pleasure; you nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.
You have condemned, and you have killed the righteous one. He does not resist you.
Be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and late rains.
You also be patient. Make your hearts firm, for the coming of the Lord is near.
Do not complain utter a deep sigh against one another, that you not be judged. Behold, the judge is standing at the door.
Brothers, accept the example of suffering and patience by the prophets who spoke in the name of God.
As you know, those who have endured are called blessed. You have heard of the patience perseverance endurance of Job, and have seen the outcome Jehovah provided, how he was very tender with his affection and mercy.
Above all things, my brothers do not swear by heaven, or by earth, or by any other oath. Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No. That way you will not fall under judgment.
Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.
Is any among you sick? Let him call the elders of the congregation. Let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of God.
The prayer of faith will save the sick person. God will raise him up; and if he committed sins, it will be forgiven him.
Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man helps much.
Elijah was a man of like passions with us. He prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
He prayed again; and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth, and one brings him back,
let him know, that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a person from death, and cover a multitude of sins.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are temporary residents scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
You who are chosen and foreknown by God the Father. You have been sanctified by the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood. Grace and peace be greatly increased to you.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
You are born to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away and is reserved in heaven for you.
You are protected by God’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
You greatly rejoice in this, though you have been grieved with various trials for a little while.
The proof of your faith is more precious than gold that perishes. Though it is tested by fire, it may be found in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
You love him without seeing him. Though you do not see him, you believe in him. Full of glory, you rejoice greatly with indescribable joy.
You receive your salvation as the outcome of your faith.
Concerning this salvation the prophets inquired and searched diligently! They prophesied about the grace that should come to you:
searching what time or what manner of time the spirit of Christ that was in them did point to, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.
God revealed to the prophets that the things they spoke were not for their own benefit but for yours. The Holy Spirit was sent from heaven to make known to you what the prophets spoke. Those who spread the good news to you did this. These are things even the angels want to look into.
Brace up your minds. Remain sober, and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
Live as children of obedience. Do not fashion yourself according to your former lusts, for you were ignorant at that time.
Be holy in all your conduct, just as the one who called you is holy.
Because it is written: "You shall be holy for I am holy."
If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man’s work, pass the time you spend here in reverence.
Know that you were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your fathers. The redemption was not with corruptible things like silver or gold,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb without spot, even the blood of Christ.
Jesus was known before the foundation of the world. He was made known at the end times for your sake.
Through him you believe in God. God raised him from the dead, and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God.
You have purified your hearts by obeying the truth. You have genuine affection for the brothers and sisters. So always love one another intensely extremely deeply from the heart.
You have been given a new birth, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and endures.
All people are like grass. All their glory is like the blossom of a flower. The grass withers and the flower drops off.
But the word of our God abides forever. This is the word of good tidings that was preached to you.
Put away all badness and all deception, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil talk.
Like newborn infants, long for the spiritual milk that is without deception to help you grow to salvation.
You have tasted that the Lord is kind.
You came to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and precious with God.
You also as living stones are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
The scriptures say: "I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, chosen and precious. He who believes in him will not be disappointed shamed."
This precious value is for those who believe. But for the unbeliever: "The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone."
It is a stone that people stumble over, and a large rock that people find offensive. They stumble because they are disobedient to the word. To this end they were appointed.
You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people for God’s own possession, that you may show the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
In time past you were no people, but now you are the people of God. You had not then received, but now have received mercy compassion divine kindness.
Beloved, I request that you as aliens and strangers abstain from fleshly lust desires, which causes conflict in you.
Maintain fine behavior among the nations. That way when they speak badly about you, they may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation inspection.
Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it is to the king,
or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do good.
It is God’s will that you do the right things and that this will silence the ignorance of foolish men.
Be free, and yet do not use your freedom for a covering for evil, but as servants of God.
Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Reverence and respect God. Honor the king.
Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle master but also to the hard to please.
For this is to your credit to suffer wrongfully and endure grief because of your conscience toward God.
What value is there when you sin, and are buffeted for it, you take it patiently? But if, when you do well and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
For this you were called because Christ also suffered for you. He left you an example a copy for imitation a model that you should follow in his steps.
He committed no sin and deception was not found in him.
When he was reviled insulted, he did not revile in return. When he suffered he did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judges righteously.
He bore our sins in his body upon the stake, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed because of his wounds stripes.
For you were straying like sheep. But now you have returned to your shepherd and overseer.
In like manner, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands. Even if your husband does not obey God’s word, he may be won without a word by observing the way you live.
Your husband could see your chaste behavior coupled with respect reverence.
Your appearance should not come from the outward adornment, things like braiding the hair, and wearing jewels of gold, or wearing fine apparel.
Let your appearance be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. This is of great value in the sight of God.
The holy women of old, who hoped in God, adorned themselves this way, being submissive to their own husbands.
Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You are her children now, if you do what is right and are not fearful.
In the same way, you husbands live with your wives in an understanding way. Honor the woman as the weaker vessel. For you are joint-heirs of the grace of life. May your prayers not be hindered cut-off blocked.
Finally, all of you be like-minded, compassionate, brotherly, tenderhearted, and humble.
Do not repay evil for evil, or insult for insult. Do just the opposite. For you were called to inherit a blessing.
Whoever would love life and see good days should keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.
Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah God are upon the righteous. His ears hear their prayers. But the face person of Jehovah is against those who do evil.
Who will harm you if you are eager to do good?
Even if you suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. Do not fear! Do not be troubled distressed intimidated!
Sanctify the Christ as Lord kurios: master in your hearts. Always be ready to answer every man who asks you a reason for your hope, yet with meekness mildness and respect!
Keep a good conscience. When you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.
It is better to suffer for doing what is right, if suffering is God’s will, than to suffer for doing evil wrong sin.
Because Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.
He preached to the people in prison.
They were disobedient while the ark was being built. Yet God waited patiently in the days of Noah. But few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.
This was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you. It is not the washing off of bodily dirt, but the promise made to God for a good conscience. It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
He is in heaven at the right hand of God, ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers.
Since Christ suffered physically for us, you too must strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking that he had. Whoever suffers physically has ceased from sin.
From now on you must live the rest of your earthly lives controlled by God’s will and not by human desires lusts.
You have spent enough time in the past doing what unbelievers like to do. Your lives were spent in indecency, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and the disgusting worship of idols false gods.
They think it strange that you do not run with them in wild and reckless living and they speak evil about you.
They will give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
The good news was preached for this purpose even to the dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but may live according to God in the spirit.
The end of all things is near. Be of sound mind and judgment. Also be sober for the purpose of prayer.
Above all things have intense love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.
Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
According to the gift you have received, minister among yourselves, as good stewards of the increased grace divine influence love of God.
If any man speaks, speak as it were utterances of God. If any man ministers, minister with the strength which God supplies! May God be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ. The glory and dominion belong to God forever and ever. Amen.
Beloved ones do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, for it comes upon you like a test, as though some strange thing were happening to you.
As much as you are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.
If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people’s business.
If a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.
For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God. If it begins with us first what will it be like in the end for those who do not obey the good news of God?
If the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinners appear?
Let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend themselves in well doing to a faithful Creator.
I exhort the elders among you. I too am an older man and a witness of the sufferings of Christ. I am also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed.
Shepherd the flock of God in your care. Exercise the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God. Do not do it for dishonest gain, but eagerly.
Do not lord it over your charge, but make yourselves examples to the flock.
When the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.
Likewise, you younger men, be subject to the older men. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and serve one another. God resists the proud, but gives loving kindness to the humble.
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you at the proper time.
Throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.
Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking whom he may devour consume.
Stand firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brothers in the world.
After you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will perfect, establish, and strengthen you.
To him is the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast.
She that is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all that are in Christ.
Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!
His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness. This is through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue excellence.
He offered us his precious and exceedingly great promises. Through these you may become partakers of the divine nature. You will escape from the corruption that is in the lust-filled world.
Yes, for this very reason you do your part with all diligence. Supply virtue to your faith. Add knowledge to your virtue.
Include self-control with your knowledge. Supply patience to your self-control. Your patience should be helped by godliness.
Add brotherly kindness to your godliness. And to your brotherly kindness add love.
For if these things are yours and abound in you they will keep you from being inactive or unfruitful regarding the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For he who lacks these qualities is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
Brothers, be more diligent to make your calling and election choosing sure. If you do practice exercise apply these things, you will never stumble!
For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly abundantly supplied to you.
I will always be ready to remind you of these things. Even though you know them, and are established in the truth that is present with you.
I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by reminding you.
I know that putting off my earthly dwelling is imminent, even as our Lord Jesus Christ indicated to me.
I will be diligent so that every time after my departure you will remember these things.
We did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
He received honor and glory from God the Father when he heard the voice from the Majestic Glory: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
We heard this voice from out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
We have the word of prophecy made sure steadfast firm! You do well that you pay attention to God’s Word as you would to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the daystar rises, in your hearts.
Know this first that no prophecy of scripture is for private interpretation.
For no prophecy ever came by the will of man! Men spoke from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
There arose false prophets among the people. There will be false teachers among you! They will privately bring in destructive heresies contrary doctrines, denying even the Master who bought them. They bring swift destruction on themselves.
Many will follow their lascivious filthy sensual deeds. The way of the truth will be maligned.
They speak evil words about you because of their extreme greed. They will exploit you with false evil words. Their judgment from long ago is not idle. Their destruction will not delay.
God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to captivity in pits of darkness reserved for judgment!
He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly!
He turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, and made them an example to those who are ungodly.
He delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked.
That righteous man that dwelled among them was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.
Jehovah knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to preserve the unrighteous for the Day of Judgment.
This is primarily for those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble at glorious ones but speak abusively.
Angels, though greater in might and power, do not bring an accusation of abusive judgment against them before Jehovah.
But these are creatures without reason. They were born mere animals to be taken and destroyed! They speak abusively in matters of which they are ignorant. They suffer destruction in their own course of destruction.
They suffer wrong as their reward for wrongdoing. They are men that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.
They have eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin! They entice unsteady persons. Their hearts are full of covetousness. They are children of cursing.
They went astray, forsaking the right way. They followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing.
He was rebuked for his own transgression. A beast of burden spoke with a man's voice and restrained hindered the madness of the prophet.
These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.
For, uttering arrogant words of vanity, they entice in the desires lusts of the flesh, by sensuality lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from the ones who live in error.
They promise them freedom, while they are bondservants of corruption. A man is brought into bondage by one and enslaved by another.
After they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and overcome; the last state is worse with them than the first.
For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
It happened to them according to the true proverb: "The dog returns to his own vomit, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire."
This is the second letter I write to you, beloved. I stimulate your memory in each letter.
You should remember the words that were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.
Know this first, that in the last days, mockers will come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,
Saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep in death, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God,
by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.
According to the same word, the heavens that now are, and the earth, are reserved for fire, being kept for the Day of Judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
Do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness. He is longsuffering patient toward you. He does not wish that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
The day of Jehovah will come as a thief. The heavens will pass away with a great noise. The elements shall be dissolved with intense heat. And the earth and the works in it will be burned up destroyed.
Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved destroyed, what manner of persons should you be in all holy living and godliness?
Look for and earnestly desire the coming presence of the "Day of Jehovah." The heavens being on fire will be dissolved destroyed, and the elements will melt with intense heat!
We look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells. This is according to his promise.
Seeing that you anticipate these things, be diligent that you may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.
Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation. Just as our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you.
He spoke about these things in his letters. Some things are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable distort them as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, avoid being carried away with the error of the wicked and falling from your own steadfastness.
Grow in the unmerited favor and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.
We have heard that which was from the beginning. We have also seen it with our own eyes. We looked at it and touched it with our hands. It is the Word of life.
The life was made known and we have seen and testify about it. We declare the life to you. It is the eternal life, which was with the Father and was shown to us.
We declare to you what we have seen and heard. This way you may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ!
We write these things that our joy may be made full complete.
This is the message we heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
If we say we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not live practice the truth.
If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say we have not sinned we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
My little children, I write you these things that you may not sin. If any man sin, we have an Advocate intercessor comforter helper with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous!
He is the propitiation Greek: hilasmos: atonement, compensation for our sins. Not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
We know that we know him, when we obey his commandments.
He who says: I know him, and does not obey his commandments is a liar! The truth is not in him.
Whoever obeys his Word; the love of God is made perfect complete mature in him. By this we know that we are in union with him.
He that says he lives in union with him should walk as he walked.
Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word that you heard.
Then again, I do write a new commandment to you. This is true in him and in you. The darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.
He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness!
He who loves his brother lives in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling offence in him.
But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness. He does not know where he goes because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
I write to you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.
I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.
I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
The entire world, the desire of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of material wealth, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
The world and its desires lusts are passing away; but he who does the will of God lives forever.
Little children, it is the last hour! You heard that the antichrist is coming. Even now many antichrists have come. That is how we know that it is the last hour.
They went out from us, but they were not of us. If they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they went out that it made it plain that they all are not of us.
You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he who denies the Father and the Son.
Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.
As for you, let that live in you, which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning lives in you, you will also live in the Son, and in the Father.
This is the promise he promised us, life eternal.
I write you these things concerning those who would lead you astray.
The anointing special endowment of Holy Spirit you received from Him is a part of you is with you and you do not need anyone any human to teach you. His anointing taught you concerning all things. It is no lie. It is truth, just as you were taught you live through him.
Now, my little children dwell Greek: meno: stay, dwell, be present with him. If he shall be made known we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming presence being near.
If you know that he is righteous you know that every one who practices righteousness is born of him.
Observe the love the Father gave to us that we should be called the children of God. That is what we are! For this reason the world does not know us. This is because it did not know him.
Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be. We know that when he is revealed we will be like him. We will see him just as he is.
Everyone who has this hope in him is purified. He is pure.
Everyone who practices exercises sin also commits lawlessness, because sin is lawlessness.
You know that he appeared to take away sins. There is no sin in him!
Whoever abides in him does not sin. Whoever sins has not seen him and does not know him.
My little children let no man deceive you! He who practices righteousness is righteous, even as he Christ is righteous.
He who sins is of the devil. For the devil sinned from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was made known manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
Whoever is born of God does not practice sin! His seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he has been born of God.
In this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not from God. He who does not love his brother is not from God.
This is the message you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another!
We should not be like Cain who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he murder him? It was because his works were evil, and his brother's were righteous.
Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.
We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.
Whoever hates his brother is a murderer! You know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him.
By this we know love, because he Jesus gave his life for us. We ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
Whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his compassion from him, how does the love of God dwell in him?
My Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.
By this we shall know we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before him.
If our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us we have confidence toward God.
Whatever we ask we receive from Him because we obey His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.
This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another. He gave us this commandment!
The one who obeys God's commandments lives in God, and God lives in with Him. We know that He lives in with us by the Spirit He gave us.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit. Test the spirits to see whether they are from God. This is because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
Here is how you know the Spirit of God, every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God.
Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that you heard was coming and now it is already in the world.
You are of God, my little children. You have overcome them because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world.
They are from the world. They speak that which is from the world and the world listens to them.
We are from God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the vital principle spirit of truth, and the principle spirit of deception error.
Beloved let us love one another, for love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
He who does not love does not know God for God is love.
The love of God was made known through us. God sent his only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation atonement sacrificial payment for our sins.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
No one has seen God at any time! If we love one another, God lives with us, and his love is perfected accomplished matured through us.
We know that we live with him and he with us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
We see and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives with him, and he with God.
We know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love! He who continues with love lives with God and God lives with him.
This is love made perfect through us, that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment. Just as he is, we are, amid exposed to this world.
There is no fear in love. Perfect mature love throws out expels fear because fear involves restraint punishment. He who fears is not made perfect mature complete through love.
We love, because he first loved us.
If a man says, I love God, yet he hates his brother, he is a liar! He who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
We have this commandment from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.
Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves him that causes the birth also loves him that is born.
This is how we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.
For this is the love of God, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
Everything born from God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world, even our faith.
Who is the one who conquers overcomes prevails over the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ. He did not come with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. The Spirit gives witness because it is the truth.
There are three that testify: Latin Vulgate: tres testimonium: three that testify.
The Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three are in agreement accord concurrence harmony. Latin Vulgate: Spiritus et aqua et sanguis et tres unum: Spirit, water, and blood are united.
If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. The witness of God is this, that he gave witness concerning his Son.
He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in him. He who does not believe God made him a liar because he does not believe the testimony God gives concerning his Son.
The testimony is this that God gave us everlasting life and this life is in his Son.
He who has the Son has the life. He who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
I wrote these things so you who believe in the name of the Son of God may know you have everlasting life.
This is the confidence that we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
If we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions requests that we have asked of him.
If any man see his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he will ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not leading to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I do not say that he should make request concerning this.
All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not leading to death.
We know that no one who is born of God practices sin. He who was born from God watches over himself, and the evil one does not touch him.
We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the under control of the evil one.
We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding. We know him that is true for we are in him who is true, and in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and everlasting life.
My little children guard protect yourselves from idols.
The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all who know the truth.
The truth lives in our hearts forever.
In truth and love, God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father send you grace, mercy and peace.
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
Now I ask you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
This is love that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment that you heard from the beginning. You should walk in it.
For many deceivers have gone into the world. They do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
Watch yourselves that you do not lose the things that we worked to produce. You may receive a full reward.
Whoever pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ, does not have God! He who dwells in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
Do not receive anyone into your house who comes to you and does not bring this teaching. Give him no greeting!
He who greets him partakes of his evil works.
I have many things to write you. I would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.
The children of your sister the chosen one greet you.
The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love. That righteous man that dwelled among them was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in good health. May you prosper.
For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and witnessed about the truth that is in you and that you walk in truth.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.
Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you do for the brothers and strangers.
They testify about your love seen by the congregation. You do well to send them forward on their journey worthily of God.
For the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the people of the nations.
We ought to receive and welcome such ones, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
I wrote something to the congregation. But Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.
If I come, I will remind you of what he does. He unjustly accuses us with wicked words and is never satisfied. He does not allow the brothers to greet one another and he throws them out of the congregation.
Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is from God. He who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has the witness of all men, and of the truth itself. Yes, we also testify and you know our witness is true.
I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write them to you with ink and pen.
I hope to see you shortly. We shall speak face to face. Peace to you! The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
Mercy, peace and love be multiplied to you.
Beloved, I diligently wrote you about our common salvation. I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the holy ones.
Certain men crept in unnoticed. They were appointed long ago for this condemnation. These ungodly men turned the grace of our God into loose conduct. They deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
I want to remind you though you once knew this, that Jehovah God, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
Angels who did not keep their position left their proper habitation. He has kept them in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them are an example for they, in like manner with these surrendered to fornication and went after flesh for unnatural use. They received justice by ever burning fire.
In like manner these men also in their dreams defile the flesh, reject authority and speak evil of glorious ones.
Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil disputed about the body of Moses. He did not speak evil judgment against him in abusive terms, but said: "Jehovah rebukes you."
These men speak abusively about things they do not know. What they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, they corrupt themselves.
Woe to them! They went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the rebellious talk of Korah.
These men are hidden rocks in your love feasts when they feast entertain with you. They are shepherds that without fear feed themselves. They are clouds without water, carried along by winds. They are autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots.
They are wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame. They are wandering stars, for which the black darkness has been reserved forever.
Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these, saying: "Behold, Jehovah came with many thousands of his holy ones.
"They execute judgment upon all. They convict all the ungodly of all their wicked behavior, deeds that they have committed in an irreverent way, and of all the hard things those detestable sinners have spoken against him."
These murmur, complain, and walk after their lusts, they speak arrogantly, flattering people to gain advantage.
But you, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
They said to you: In the last time there will be mockers scoffers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.
These cause divisions; they are sensual worldly-minded persons not having the Spirit.
You, beloved, build yourself up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.
Stay in the love of God! Look wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for everlasting life.
Show mercy to some who have doubt.
Save some, snatch them out of the fire. Have mercy on some with alarm. Hate even the garment defiled polluted by the flesh.
Now to him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish with exceeding joy.
To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord. There is glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, now, and for evermore, amen.
THE REVELATION GOD GAVE TO JESUS CHRIST, so that he could tell his servants the things that must soon take place. Christ then sent his angel to communicate the symbolic message to his servant John.
John testified to the word of God, the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all that he saw.
Happy is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and obey the things written in it: for the time is near.
John, to the seven congregations in Asia: May you have grace and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;
And from Jesus Christ, who is the Faithful Witness, and the firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood.
He made us to be a kingdom of kings and priests to his God and Father. To him be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
Behold, he comes with the clouds. Every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn over him. So it will be, Amen.
" I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, " says Jehovah God, " the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty all ruling universal sovereign."
I, John, your brother and companion in tribulation and kingdom and perseverance patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, because of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day when I heard a strong voice behind me. It sounded like a trumpet.
It said: " Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven congregations in Asia: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. "
I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. When I turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.
There was someone like the Son of man in the midst of the seven lamp stands. He was clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet, and girded at the chest with a golden girdle.
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were like a flame of fire.
His feet were like fine brass glowing in a furnace. His voice sounded like many rushing waters.
In his right hand he held seven stars. A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth. His appearance was like the shinning sun in full strength.
When I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet. He laid his right hand on me and said: " Do not fear. I am the first and the last:
" I am alive! I was dead and, behold, I am alive forever, Amen. I have the keys of death and the grave.
" Write the things that you have seen and the things that are and the things that will be.
" This is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven congregations. The seven lamp stands that you saw are the seven congregations. "
" To the angel of the congregation of Ephesus write: The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lamp stands, says:
" ' I know your works, and your labor, and your patience. I also know how you cannot tolerate those who are evil. You tested those who say they are apostles. They are not apostles. You found them to be liars.
" ' You have endured and are patient. You suffer for my name's sake and have not grown weary.
" ' However I have this against you: you do not love me now as you did at first.
" ' Think how far you have fallen! Turn from your sins repent and do what you did at first. If you do not turn from your sins, I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place.
" ' Yet you have this in your favor: you hate the deeds of the sect of Nicolaus just as I hate their deeds.
" ' He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations! To him who overcomes I will give the right to eat the fruit of the tree of life that grows in the Paradise Garden of God. '
" To the angel of the congregation in Smyrna write: This is the message from the one who is the ' First and the Last', who died and came to life again.
" ' I know your troubles. I know that you are poor, but you are rich! I know the evil things said against you by those who claim to be Jews but are not. Their synagogue belongs to Satan!
" ' Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil false accuser Devil is about to throw you into prison, that you may be tested. You will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful even if you must die, and I will give you the crown of life.
" ' He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death. '
" To the angel of the congregation in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword:
" ' I know where you live and where the throne of Satan is. You cling to my name and have not denied my faith, even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness. He was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
" ' I have a few things against you: you have people there who hold to the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to present a snare to the sons of Israel, to eat of idol sacrifices and commit fornication.
" ' You also have those who hold the doctrine teaching of the sect of Nicolaus in like manner.
" ' Turn away from your sins! If you do not repent I will come to you soon. And I will fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth.
" ' He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the congregations! To those who overcome in victory I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give each of them a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it. '
" To the angel of the congregation in Thyatira write: This is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes blaze like fire, whose feet shine like polished brass.
" ' I know your works. I know your love, your faithfulness, your service, and your patience. I know that you are doing more now than you did at first.
" ' But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads my servants astray so that they commit immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.
" ' I gave her time to repent, and she does not want to repent of her immorality.
" ' Watch this! I am going to throw her into a sickbed. Those who commit sexual sins with her will also suffer much trouble, unless they repent and turn away from what she is doing.
" ' I will kill her children with deadly plague. Then all the congregations will know that I am the one who searches hearts and minds. I will reward each of you for what you have done.
" ' But to the rest of you in Thyatira, all who do not hold on to Jezebel's teaching, who have not learned what are called the " deep things of Satan, " I will not burden you with anything else.
" ' Just hold on to what you have until I come.
" ' To the person who conquers and continues to do my works to the end, I will give power authority over the nations.
" ' He will rule them with a rod of iron and break them to pieces like clay vessels: even as I received from my Father.
" ' I will give him the morning star.
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. ' "
" To the angel of the congregation in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says these things: ' I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, and you are really dead.
" ' Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain that are at the point of death: for I have not found your works perfect completed before God.
" ' Remember what you received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If you do not stay awake, I will come to you like a thief. You will not know the hour when I will come to you.
" ' You have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled defiled their garments. They will walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
" ' He who overcomes will be clothed in white garments. I will not blot out his name from the book of life. In fact I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. '
" To the angel of the congregation in Philadelphia write: He says these things. He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens.
" ' I know your works deeds acts. Pay attention, I set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.
" ' I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, for they lie; I will make them come and bow down before your feet. They will know that I have loved you.
" ' Because you have kept the word of my patience endurance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing. This will come upon the whole world to test scrutinize discipline examine those who dwell on the earth.
" ' I come quickly: hold fast what you have so that no one will take your crown.
" ' I will make the one who overcomes, a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will not go out from it anymore. I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is the New Jerusalem. This city comes down out of heaven from my God. I will write my new name on him.
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. '
" ' To the angel of the congregation in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God’s creation says this:
" ' I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were cold or hot.
" ' Because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.
" ' You say, " I am rich and have become wealthy and have need of nothing. " You do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.
" ' I counsel you to buy gold from me, gold purified by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be clothed. In this way the shame of your nakedness will not appear. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, so that you may see.
" ' I reprove and discipline those whom I love: be zealous therefore, and repent.
" ' Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him, and dine with him, and he with me.
" ' To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
" ' He who can hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. ' "
After this I saw a door opened in heaven: and the first voice that I heard was talking to me like a trumpet. It said: " Come up here and I will show you things from the future. "
Immediately I was in the spirit. In front of me was a throne in heaven and someone sat on the throne.
He who sat there had the appearance of jasper and sardius stones. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne.
Around the throne were twenty-four elders sitting on thrones. They were dressed in white with crowns of gold on their heads.
Lightnings and thunders and voices came from the throne. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.
A sea of crystal like glass was in front of the throne. In the center around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like a young bull. The third living creature had a face like a man. And the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
Each of the four living creatures has six wings. They are full of eyes around and within. " Never resting day or night, they say: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come. "
When these living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
The twenty-four elders fall down before the one seated on the throne. They worship him who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
" You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and because of your will they are and were created. "
I saw a book in the right hand of him who sat on the throne. It had writing on the inside and on the back and was sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice: " Who is worthy to open the book, and to remove the seals? "
No one in heaven, on earth or under the earth was able to open the book and look inside.
I wept much because no one was found worthy to open, look inside, and read the book.
One of the elders said to me: " Do not weep; the Lion of the tribe of Judah of the Root of David has succeeded in opening the book and removing the seven seals. "
I saw a Lamb that looked as though it had been slain, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders. The lamb had seven horns and seven eyes. These are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.
He came to the one who sat on the throne and received the book from his right hand.
When he took the book the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Every one of them had harps, and golden bowls full of incense. These are the prayers of the holy ones.
They sing a new song, saying: " You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals, for you were slaughtered and by your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
" You made them kings and priests to our God. They will reign as kings over the earth. "
I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders. The number of them was ten thousand myriads times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.
They said with a loud voice: " The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. "
I heard every creature in heaven and on earth. I also heard those under the earth, in the sea, and all that are in them. They said: " Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever. "
The four living creatures said: " Amen " and the twenty-four elders fell down and worshipped.
I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals. And I heard one of the living creatures speak with a voice like thunder. He said: " Come! "
I saw a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him and he conquered.
When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: " Come! "
Another horse that was red went out: and power was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth. He was given a great sword so that men could kill one another.
When he opened the third seal I heard the third beast say: " Come! " I saw a black horse; and he who sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: " A measure quart: U. S. dry. of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see that you do not hurt the oil and the wine. "
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: " Come! "
I looked, and there was a pale horse. The name of the one who sat on him was Death. The grave followed him. Power was given to them over a fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with pestilence, and with the beasts of the earth.
When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the persons who were slaughtered because of the word of God, and for the witness they gave.
They cried with a loud voice, saying: " How long, O Lord, holy and true, before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth? "
Each of them was given a white robe. They were told that they should rest for a little while. They were to wait until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers, who would be killed, as they were, should be fulfilled.
When he opened the sixth seal I saw a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood.
The stars of the sky fell to the earth, even as a fig tree drops her unripe figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.
The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled together. Every mountain and island was moved from their places.
The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the military commanders, and the mighty men, and every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.
They said to the mountains and rocks: " Fall on us, and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
" For the great day of his wrath has come; and who will be able to stand? "
After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth so the wind would not blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.
I saw another angel ascending from the east. He had the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea.
He said: " Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. "
I heard the number of those who were sealed. There were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand from all the tribes of the children of Israel.
Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
After this I saw a great crowd that no man could number. It was from all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues. It stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes. They had palm branches in their hands.
They cried with a loud voice, saying: " Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb. "
All the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures. They fell before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God.
They said: " Amen! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen. "
One of the elders asked me: " Who are these dressed in white robes? And where are they from? "
I said to him: " Sir, you know. " He said to me: " These are the ones who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
" Because of this they are before the throne of God. They serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tent over dwell among them.
" They will hunger no more, nor thirst any more; neither shall the sunlight beat down on them, nor any heat.
" The Lamb who is in the middle of the throne will feed them and lead them to living fountains of water. God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. "
When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about a half an hour.
I saw the seven angels who stood before God. Seven trumpets were given to them.
Another angel, with a golden incense vessel, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense so he could offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones upon the golden altar before the throne.
The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the holy ones, ascended up, out of the angel's hand, before God.
The angel took the incense vessel, and filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth. There were voices, and thundering and lightning, and an earthquake.
The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood came down upon the earth. A third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
The second angel blew his trumpet. Something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood.
A third of the living creatures in the sea died. And a third of the ships were destroyed.
The third angel blew his trumpet. A great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven. It fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters.
The star is called Wormwood Calamity Bitterness: and a third of the waters became wormwood; and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was struck. A third of the moon, and a third of the stars were darkened. The illumination of both day and night was cut by one third.
Then I saw and heard an angel flying in midheaven. He said with a loud voice: " Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound! "
The fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth. The key of the bottomless pit was given to him.
He opened the bottomless pit. Smoke came out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace. The smoke from the pit darkened the sun and the air.
Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth. Power was given to them like the scorpions of the earth have power.
They were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.
The locusts were not to kill them, but should torment them for five months: and their torment was the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.
Men will seek death in those days and will not find it. They will desire to die and death will elude them.
The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. They wore gold crowns on their heads and their faces were like the faces of men.
Their hair was like the hair of women. Their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
They had breastplates like iron. The sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses running to battle.
Their tails were like scorpions' tails, for there were stings in their tails. They had power to hurt men five months.
The angel of the bottomless pit was their king. His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.
The first woe is past. There are two more woes to come.
The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the golden altar that is before God.
It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.
And the four angels were released. They were prepared for this very hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill a third of mankind.
The army of the horsemen numbered two hundred million. I heard their number.
I saw the horses and riders in the vision. Their breastplates were bright red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. Their mouths issued fire, smoke, and brimstone.
A third of mankind was killed by these plagues of fire and smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents that had heads, and with them they inflict harm.
The rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands. They did not stop worshipping demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk.
Neither did they repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven. He was clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was upon his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
He held a little book that lay open in his hand. He placed his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth.
And he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven say to me: " Seal up those things that the seven thunders spoke. Do not write them. "
The angel I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth raised his hand to heaven.
And he swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things there, that there would be no more delay.
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will sound his trumpet, the secret of God is finished, just as he declared to his servants the prophets.
The voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said: " Go take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the earth. "
I went to the angel, and said to him: " Give me the little book. " He said to me: " Take it, and eat it up! It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will make your belly bitter. "
So I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it. It was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
He said: " You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations, tongues and kings. "
There was given me a reed like a measuring rod: and the angel stood, saying: " Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship there.
" Do not measure the court outside the temple for it is given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.
" I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. "
These witnesses are the two olive trees, and the two lamp stands standing before the God of the earth.
If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies. If any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
These two witnesses have power to shut the sky so that it will not rain in the days of their prophecy. They have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
When they finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and conquer them, and kill them.
Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was impaled.
The people and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and will look at them and refuse to bury them.
The inhabitants of the earth will celebrate and rejoice over them. They will rejoice and send gifts to one another. This is because these two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth.
After three and a half days the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet. Great fear fell upon all who saw them.
They heard a great voice from heaven say: " Come up here. " So they ascended up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies beheld them.
In that same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand men were slain in the earthquake, and the survivors were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe has past. The third woe will come quickly.
The seventh angel blew his trumpet. There were great voices in heaven, saying: " The kingdom of the world has become our God’s, and his Christ will rule as king forever and ever. "
The twenty-four elders, who sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,
Saying: " We give you thanks, Jehovah God the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power, and begun to rule as king.
" The nations were angry. Your wrath indignation has come! It is time to judge the dead, to reward your servants the prophets, the holy ones, and those who reverence your name the small and the great. Time to destroy exterminate eradicate those who destroy the earth. "
The temple of God was opened in heaven. There was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant. And there were lightnings and voices and thunder and an earthquake and great hail.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head was a crown with twelve stars.
She, being with child, cried out in labor pains, ready to deliver.
Another sign appeared in heaven. It was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
His tail swept a third of the stars of heaven, and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered. He was ready to devour her child as soon as it was born.
She gave birth to a male-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod scepter of iron. Her child was caught up to God and to his throne.
The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God. There they feed her a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
War broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.
The dragon lost and no place in heaven was found for him any longer.
The great dragon was thrown down, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was hurled down to the earth, and his angels with him.
I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, " Now has come the salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accused them before our God day and night.
They conquered overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they did not love their lives when faced with death.
Therefore rejoice be glad, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. But woe to the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having fierce anger, because he knows that he has only a short time. "
When the dragon saw that he was thrown to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male-child.
Two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time one thousand two hundred and sixty days, out of the serpent's reach.
The serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.
But the earth rescued the woman, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood that the dragon spewed out of his mouth.
The dragon was furious with the woman and waged war with the remnant of her seed. These are the ones who obey the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
The dragon stood on the shore by the sea. I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns. His horns had ten crowns on them. Blasphemous names were on his heads.
The beast I saw looked like a leopard. His feet were like the feet of a bear. His mouth was like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority.
One of his heads appeared to have had a fatal wound. His fatal wound had healed, and the entire world followed the beast with admiration.
Men worshiped the dragon that gave power to the beast. They worshiped the beast, saying: " Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him? "
A mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given to the beast. And authority to act was given to him to continue forty-two months.
He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, to slander his name, and his dwelling place, and those who live in heaven.
It was granted to him to wage war with the holy ones, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all tribes, and tongues, and nations.
All the citizens of earth will worship him, all whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life who was slain from the foundation of the world.
If any man can listen, let him hear.
He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity. He who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. This requires the patience and the faith of the holy ones.
Then I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.
He exercises all the authority of the first beast that came ahead of him. The second beast causes the earth and those who live there to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
He performed great signs, so that he made fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.
And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles he had power to do in the sight of the beast. He says to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast that had the wound by a sword and yet lives.
He had power to give breath to the image of the beast and to make that image of the beast speak. He caused many to be killed, those who would not worship the image of the beast.
And he forces all persons, the great and the small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.
No one could buy or sell without the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
This requires wisdom. Let him that has understanding calculate the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
A Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.
I heard a sound from heaven, as the sound of many waters. It was as the sound of a great thunder: and I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.
They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders. No man can learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.
These are they who were not defiled with women. They are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed bought from among mankind. They are the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.
No falsehood lie deceit was found in their mouth, for they are without fault.
Then I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven. He had everlasting good news to preach to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.
He spoke in a loud voice: " Respect God, and give him glory! The hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. "
Another angel followed, saying: " Babylon the great has fallen. She has fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. "
The third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: " If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
" the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation. He will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
" The smoke of their torment will ascend forever and ever. They who worship the beast and his image and receive the mark of his name have no rest day or night.
" This requires patience and endurance for the holy ones, those who obey the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. "
Then I heard a voice from heaven say: " Write: Blessed are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time forward: Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works follow them. "
I saw a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud: " Thrust in your sickle, and reap! The time has come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. "
He who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
And yet another angel came out from the altar. He had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle. He said: " Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. "
The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the anger of God.
The winepress was trampled outside the city. Blood came out of the winepress as high up as the horse bridles for a distance of one hundred and eighty miles.
I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues. God uses them to finish expressing his anger.
I saw what looked like a sea of glass mingled with fire. Those who were victorious over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having harps written Word of God.
They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: " Great and marvelous are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of the ages Eternal King King of the nations King of the holy ones.
" Who will not reverence you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, for only you are holy. All nations will come and worship you. Your righteous judgments are clearly apparent. "
After that I noticed the temple of the sanctuary of the tent of witness was opened in heaven.
The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple. They were clothed in pure white linen, with their chests girded with golden girdles.
One of the four beasts gave the seven angels bowls full of the anger of God who lives forever and ever.
The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and power of God. No man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
I heard a loud voice from the temple say to the seven angels: Go your way, and pour out the bowls of the anger of God on the earth.
The first poured out his bowl on the earth. A painful and grievous sore appeared on the men who had the mark of the beast, and upon those who worshiped his image.
Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea. It became like the blood of a dead man, and every living being died in the sea.
Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood.
I heard the angel of the waters say: " You are righteous, Jehovah, who are, and was, the Holy One, because you have judged these things.
" They have shed the blood of the holy ones and prophets. You give them blood to drink for they deserve it. "
I heard another say: " Even so, Jehovah God the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments. "
The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun. Authority was given to him to scorch men with fire.
Men were scorched with great heat. They blasphemed the name of God, who has power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.
Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became full of darkness. And they gnawed their tongues because of the pain.
They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains, but they did not repent.
The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates. Its water was dried up so that the way might be prepared for the kings from the east.
I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
They are demonic spirits, working signs, which go to the kings of the earth, of the whole world. They gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
" Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his outer garment, that he does not walk naked and they see his shame. "
He gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue Har-Magedon.
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came out of the temple of heaven. It said: " It is done! "
There were voices, and thunders, and lightnings. There was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered Babylon the Great. He gave her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his anger wrath.
Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
There fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent 45 to 100 pounds. Men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceeding great.
One of the seven angels who had one of the seven bowls spoke to me. He said: " Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
" with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. "
So he carried me away in spirit to the wilderness. I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast. The beast was full of names of blasphemy. It had seven heads and ten horns.
The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet. She was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls. She had a golden cup in her hand. It was full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.
A name was written on her forehead, a mystery, " Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth. "
I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy ones, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her I wondered greatly.
The angel said: " Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
" The beast that you saw was, and is not. It will ascend out of the pit and go into destruction. They who dwell on the earth will wonder, those whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
" Here is where the mind that has wisdom comes in. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
" There are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the other has not yet come. When he comes he must remain a short while.
" The beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth king, and is from the seven, and goes into destruction.
" The ten horns that you saw are ten kings. They have not yet received a kingdom. But they receive power authority influence as kings for one hour with the beast.
" They are united in one purpose single-minded, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.
" They will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome conquer them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. Those who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. "
He says to me: " The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and crowds, and nations, and languages.
" The ten horns that you saw on the beast will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
" For God put in their hearts the desire to carry out his purpose, and to agree, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
" The woman you saw is that great city that reigns over the kings of the earth. "
After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven. He had great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.
He cried out with a strong voice: " Babylon the Great has fallen, she has fallen! She has become the habitation of demons, and a haunt for every unclean spirit. She is a prison for every unclean and hateful bird.
" All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication immorality. The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are very rich through the abundance of her luxury. "
I heard another voice from heaven, say: " Come out of her, my people, that you do not partake of her sins, and that you do not receive her plagues!
" For her sins have reached up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
" Render to her even as she rendered to you. Pay back double to her, double according to her works: in the cup that she has filled, fill double for her!
" To the extent she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to that extent give her much torment and sorrow. She says in her heart: ' I sit a queen, and am no widow, and I shall see no sorrow. '
" Therefore her plagues literal and figurative will overtake her in one day, death and mourning and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire, for mighty is Jehovah God who judges her.
" The kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke of her burning.
" They will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, and say: ' Woe, woe to the great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come. '
" The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her. For no man buys their merchandise any more.
" The merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones, and of pearls, fine linen, purple and silk, scarlet, and everything in scented wood, all manner of ivory and all manner of most precious wood, of brass and iron and marble,
" cinnamon, odors and ointments, frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour, wheat, beasts, and sheep and horses, chariots and slaves and humans
" The fruits that you desired have departed from you. All things that were dainty and wonderful have departed from you. You will find them no more at all.
" The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing.
" They will say: ' Woe, woe to the great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
" ' In one hour these great riches came to nothing. ' Every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood far off,
" and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying: ' What city is like this great city! '
" They threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying: ' Woe, woe to the great city. All that had ships in the sea became rich by her wealth. In one hour she was made desolate. '
" Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God pronounced judgment for you against her. "
A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea. He said: " With violence the great city Babylon will be thrown down, and it will not be found any longer.
" The sound of harp players, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, will not be heard anymore in you. No craftsman will be found in you. The sound of a millstone will not be heard in you anymore.
" There will no longer be the light of a candle in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your spiritistic practice all nations were deceived.
" The blood of prophets, and of holy ones, and of all who were slain upon the earth was found in her. "
After these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying: " Praise Jehovah! Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power belong to our God.
" True and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her fornication. And has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. "
Again they said: " Praise Jehovah. Her smoke rose up forever and ever. "
The twenty-four elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God, who sat on the throne, saying: " Amen! Praise Jehovah! "
Then a voice came from the throne. It said: " Praise our God, all you his servants, and you who reverence him, both small and great. "
And I heard as it were the voice of a large number of people, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunder, saying: " Praise Jehovah! For Jehovah our God, the Almighty, reigns.
" Let us be glad, rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife made herself ready.
" It was granted to her that she dress in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the holy ones. "
He said to me: " Write: Blessed are they who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. " He said to me: " These are the true sayings of God. "
I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me: "Do not do that. I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers. You have the witness from Jesus: worship God! For the witness from Jesus is the spirit mind-set of prophecy."
I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns diadems. He had a name written that no man knew, but himself.
He was clothed with a garment dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
The armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with a rod of iron. He treads the winepress of the fierceness and anger of Almighty God.
He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, " King of Kings " and " Lord of Lords "!
Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud voice to all the fowls that fly in midheaven: " Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;
" that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of military commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great. "
I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.
The beast was captured, and with him the false prophet that performed signs before him, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.
The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the one who sat on the horse. All the birds were filled with their flesh.
I saw an angel come down from heaven. He had the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
He seized the dragon, the old serpent that is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
He hurled him into the bottomless pit, and shut it and sealed it over him. He could not deceive the nations anymore till the thousand years ended. After that he must be let loose for a little while.
I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. I also saw the people who were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image. They had not received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands. They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them. They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall rule as kings with him for the thousand years.
When the thousand years end, Satan will be let loose out of his prison.
Satan will go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle. The number of these is as the sand of the sea too great to count.
They advanced over the broad plain of the earth, and encircled the camp of the holy ones, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven and devoured consumed them.
The devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are, and will be tormented day and night forever.
I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it. From before him the earth and heaven fled away. There was found no place for them.
I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. The books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged according to the things written in the books, according to their works.
The sea gave up the dead in it. Death and the grave delivered up the dead in them. Every man was judged according to his works.
Death and the grave were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
Whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled thrust thrown into the lake of fire.
I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. There was no more sea.
Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
Then I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying: " Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men. He will dwell with them and they will be his people! God will be with them, and be their God.
" God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death. There will be no more sorrow nor crying. There will be no more pain! The former things have passed away. "
He who sat on the throne said: " Behold, I make all things new. Then he told me to write: for these words are faithful and true. "
And he said to me: " It is done! I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him who thirsts from the fountain of the water of life freely.
" He who overcomes will inherit all things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.
" But the fearful and unbelieving, abominable and murderers, fornicators and those practicing spiritism, idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur: which is the second death. "
One of the seven angels came to me. He had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues. He said: " Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife. "
He carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.
She had the glory of God. Her light was like a very precious stone, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.
The city had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on each gate, the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
He who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates and the wall.
And the city lies foursquare. The length is as large as the width. He measured the city with the reed, fourteen hundred miles. The length and the width and the height of it are equal.
He measured the wall, two hundred feet, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
The structure of the wall was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
The foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each individual gate was one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.
I saw no temple there: for the Jehovah God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple.
The city did not need the sun or the moon to shine on it. For the glory of God and of the Lamb was its light.
The nations will walk by means of its light. The kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
Its gates will not close in the daytime and there will be no night there.
They will bring the glory of the nations into it.
Nothing impure will ever enter it. The shameful and deceitful will not enter. Only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life will enter.
He showed me a pure river of water of life. It was clear as crystal and flowed out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
This was in the middle of the street of the city. The tree of life was on each side of the river. It produced twelve kinds of fruit and yielded the fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
There will be no curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city. His servants will serve him.
They will see his face and his name will be in their foreheads.
There will be no night there. They need no lamp, neither light of the sun, for Jehovah God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.
Then he said to me: " These sayings are faithful and true. Jehovah the God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things that must shortly be done.
" Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who obeys the words of the prophecy of this book. "
I John saw these things and heard them. When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
He said to me: "Do not do that, for I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and of those who obey the words of this book: worship God."
And he says to me: " Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near at hand.
" He who is unjust, let him be unjust still. And he who is filthy, let him be filthy still. And he who is righteous, let him be righteous still. And he who is holy, let him be holy still.
" ' Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work.
" ' I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
" ' Blessed are those who obey his commandments. They have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates of the city.
" ' Outside are the dogs impure men and those who practice spiritism, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who tells lies. '
" ' I Jesus have sent my angel to tell you about these things in the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. ' "
The Spirit and the bride say: " Come " And let him who hears say: " Come. " And let him who is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him drink the water of life freely.
I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book.
If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things that are written in this book.
He who testifies to these things says: " I come quickly. " Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
