A really big version of this glyph may be made up of the following component glyphs. They will be stacked either horizontally or vertically. Glyphs marked as Extenders may be removed or repeated (to make shorter or longer versions).

Display information on this GNOME version
GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including translations, documentation, and quality assurance.
